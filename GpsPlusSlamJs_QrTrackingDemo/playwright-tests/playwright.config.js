 * comments named their siblings and asserted distinctness.
 *
 * Real WebXR / camera / depth are

  // to content-hashed files the rebuild renamed away — one 404, no boot, and every
  // spec that waits for the app times out looking exactly like a code defect.
  // That cost a session and a mislabelled commit on 2026-08-16.

  // parallel workers each drive a full WebGL scene, so they queue on one GPU
  // instead of overlapping, and the queueing is what expires the per-test
  // budget — every failure these suites produced on a developer machine was a
  // TIMEOUT, never an assertion.

  // THE MEASUREMENT BEHIND DEC-N8 WAS TAKEN ON THE WAYFINDING SUITE, not here:
  // serial, its seven tests finished in 26.6 s with one dropping 39.6 s ->
  // 907 ms. The reasoning transfers (same GPU, same contention), the numbers do
  // not — an earlier version of this comment was pasted verbatim into three
  // configs and claimed "all seven specs" in each, which is true of none of
  // them. Found in review of PR #336.
  // This suite: 2 spec files, 5 tests — not separately measured.
  // workers therefore buy latency and flakes, not throughput. The sibling
  // Landing and OsmDemo suites reached the same setting from their own
  // measurements — see their configs for the numbers.
