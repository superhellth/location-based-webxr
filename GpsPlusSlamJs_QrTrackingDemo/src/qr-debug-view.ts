 * QR debug view — the two on-screen objects the §5 verification gate checks

 * to the QR so its front face lands on the printed corners ("is it glued to the
 * code?"). Both are parented under `arWorldGroup` so they ride the alignment /
 * transform chain exactly like real content.
 *
 * Persistence across detection misses (Note 3): `update()` is called on every
 * lock; `clear()` is NOT called on a miss, so the objects keep their last pose
 * and never flicker between throttled detections. They stay hidden until the
 * first `update()`.
