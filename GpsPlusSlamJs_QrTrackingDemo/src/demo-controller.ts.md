# demo-controller.ts

**Purpose:** The orchestration brain of the demo (Note 4). Per throttled/coalesced
frame: detect a QR → measure size from depth (`createQrSizeMeasurer` → per-marker
running median) → once a size EXISTS, solve the full pose with the framework's
pure-JS PnP (`solveQrPose` + `PlanarPnpSquare`, position AND rotation from the
corner pixels) → on the N-consecutive-lock, record into `qrDetected` + glue the
axis + cube. Geo-less: never casts a GPS vote.

## Public API

- `createQrDemoController(deps): QrDemoController` — `{ offerFrame(image), status, reset() }`.
- `QrDemoControllerDeps` — injected `detect`, `getDepthContext`,
  `recordDetection`, `recordSize`, `updateScene`, optional `resolveStablePose`
  (windowed filtered pose for the overlay — e.g. `selectStableQrPose`), optional
  `solvePose` (defaults to `solveQrPose` + a pure-JS `PlanarPnpSquare`; inject a
  canned pose in tests), `onStatus`/`now`/ scheduler tuning.
- `DemoSolvePose = (input: Omit<SolveQrPoseInput,'solver'>) => QrPoseSolution | null`.
- `DepthContext = { unprojector, depthAt(sx,sy), cameraPose, projectionMatrix }`.
  `projectionMatrix` is the detector frame's view projection — PnP intrinsics come
  from `intrinsicsFromProjection(projectionMatrix, image.width, image.height)`.

## Invariants

- Built on the framework's generic `createDetectionScheduler` (throttle +
  coalesce + N-lock). `minIntervalMs` defaults to 0 (debug demo), `requiredLockCount` 2.
- **Pose is full PnP, not the depth-corner fit.** Depth still supplies the metric
  SIZE (`measurer.measure`); the pose comes from `solvePose({ imagePoints, sizeM,
intrinsics, cameraPose })`. Rotation no longer inherits per-corner depth noise.
  (The depth-corner `pose-from-corners.ts` hybrid-fallback was removed in the
  2026-06-17 cleanup once on-device confirmed PnP translation is robust.)
- **Size-exists gate (relaxed):** the controller places as soon as ANY size is
  measured (`estimate.estimateM !== null`) — the lever that actually glued
  on-device. The strict `estimated` lifecycle is only the production GPS-vote gate,
  not the demo overlay. **Consequence:** if the depth size never converges (noisy /
  non-planar depth), nothing is glued — PnP cannot run without a size (unlike the
  old depth-fit, which could place a pose-only axis).
- A detection whose quad fails `validateQuad` (mirrored / degenerate), a missing
  depth context, a corner with no depth read (after the measurer's inset
  fallback), a `null` size, a `null` solve, or no detection → treated as a miss
  (no record, no scene update). `validateQuad` mirrors `solveQrPose`'s guard; it
  does NOT reorder corners (the detector's order carries the reading orientation).
- **Persistence (Note 3):** a miss does NOT clear the scene (objects keep their
  last pose). `qrPoseInCamera` and `reprojectionErrorPx` come straight from the
  PnP solution.
- **Stable-pose overlay (sliding-window stabilization):** on a lock the scene is
  rendered with `resolveStablePose(text)` when it has converged (the windowed,
  outlier-rejected pose), else the raw frame pose. `recordDetection` runs first,
  so the window already includes the current frame. The ring keeps the RAW poses —
  the filtered pose is never written back. See
  [2026-06-16-followup-qr-pose-stabilization-sliding-window.md](../../../../gps-plus-slam/GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-06-16-followup-qr-pose-stabilization-sliding-window.md).
- Fully injected → unit-testable without WebXR / camera / depth.

## Tests

`demo-controller.test.ts` — injects a canned `solvePose` and a planar fake depth
context: lock records detection + size + the PnP scene update with a converged
0.2 m size; size converges to `estimated`; the size-exists gate withholds the lock
while the size is unknown (non-planar depth); a `null` solve, no depth,
no-corner-depth, no detection, and a degenerate quad all stay scanning without
recording; `resolveStablePose` overrides the rendered pose; `reset` → idle.

## Why a separate controller (O-D1 — thin-demo audit, WS-D)

This controller deliberately parallels the framework's `createQrTrackingController`
(both: detect → solve pose → emit → status machine → scheduler). The audit
(`2026-06-17-qr-size-accuracy-and-thin-demo-plan.md`, WS-D) confirmed that **every
non-trivial piece is already framework code** — `createDetectionScheduler`,
`createQrSizeMeasurer`, `solveQrPose` + `PlanarPnpSquare`, `intrinsicsFromProjection`,
`validateQuad`. What remains here is **pure wiring** plus one demo-specific policy:
the relaxed "size-exists" overlay gate (place as soon as any size is measured),
which is intentionally NOT the framework's strict `estimated` GPS-vote gate.

The demo cannot reuse `createQrTrackingController` as-is because that controller is
**level/geo-centric** (`fetchLevel` → `QrLevel`, GPS votes) and delegates size to a
`resolveSizeM(text, level)` callback that does **not** receive the per-frame
corners/image/depth the depth→size measurement needs. Unifying them (**O-D1 option
D-X**: make the framework controller level-optional + add a size-from-depth hook,
then delete this file) is the right end state, but it is **deferred until the
Recorder's live-QR path exists** — generalising shared, well-tested code for a
single consumer is premature; the second consumer should drive the abstraction. See
the follow-up `2026-06-17-followup-qr-size-thin-demo-next-steps.md` (D-X).
