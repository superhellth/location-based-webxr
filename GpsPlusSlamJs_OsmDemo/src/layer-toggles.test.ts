 * in-progress state.
 *
 * The half that needs a unit test is the FAILURE path. The e2e cannot reach it:
 * `DemoPipeline.update` collects refused tiles rather than throwing, so an HTTP
 * 400 produces a successful, empty refresh and `refresh()` never rejects. A
 * `.then` instead of a `.finally` would therefore strand the switch — disabled
 * forever — on precisely the path no browser test can produce. Mutating
 * `finally` to `then` fails the second test here and nothing else in the suite.
