/**
 * App shell: builds the store, the pipeline and the views, and wires them.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY THIN, AND NOW THINNER. Everything that can be wrong in an
 * interesting way lives in `demo-pipeline.ts` (data), `refresh-cycle.ts` (the
 * async cycle and its two failure kinds), `osm-store.ts` (shared state) and
 * `heat-colours.ts` (presentation of an unbounded quantity) — all pure, all
 * unit-tested. This file is DOM plumbing, and it is short on purpose: when the
 * demo misbehaves, the question should be answerable without reading it.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED WITH THE STORE. The views used to be driven imperatively from one
 * `doRefresh`, in a fixed order, inside one `try`. They are now subscribers:
 * nothing here decides who draws first, and each view's failure is reported as
 * its own rather than as "the refresh failed" (see `refresh-cycle.ts`).
 *
 * WHAT THIS DEMO IS FOR — three questions no test suite can answer, and one it
 * can only answer on real data:
 *
 * 1. Is `AFFORDANCE_RES = 13` (4.09 m edge) the right grain? Too coarse and a
 *    footpath vanishes; too fine and the grid is noise.
 * 2. Are the unbounded scores practically thresholdable? See `heat-colours.ts`.
 * 3. Do regions land in the right PLACES? The arithmetic has been verified
 *    against the C# oracle; the geography has not.
 * 4. Does the mesh layer produce sane buildings from real footprints?
 *
 * @see main.ts.md

  // ONLY WHEN A HUMAN MOVED THE MAP, which is what the latch is for. A quest
  // search pans the map and then aims the camera at the beacon's own height; the
  // locate button and the site picker recentre on the user. Every one of those
  // raises `moveend`, and a blanket rule would fire on them and re-aim at ground
  // level — undoing a fix made in the PR #344 review.
  // ⚠️ ARMED ON `dragend` AND NOTHING ELSE. The first version also armed on
  // `zoomstart`, to cover a drag that becomes a pinch — and that was a
  // regression, caught by the milestone review and then measured: Leaflet
  // raises `moveend` for a ZOOM as well as for a pan, so every wheel or button
  // zoom consumed the latch and snapped the camera's target to the map centre,
  // ~100 m in the e2e fixture. That silently undid the `zoomend` handler's
  // "the target is kept", which matters because the two targets diverge
  // routinely — a map click recentres the camera without moving the map, a 3D
  // drag moves the target without moving the map.
  //
  // `dragend`, not `dragstart` (PR #347 review): a latch armed for the whole
  // gesture was stolen by any programmatic `moveend` landing mid-drag — the
  // locate fix arriving while the user dragged consumed it, re-aiming the
  // camera at the recentre AND ignoring the drag when it ended. Leaflet fires
  // `dragend` before both `moveend` branches (direct, and via the inertia
  // glide), so the drag's own `moveend` still finds the latch armed and the
  // centre is still read inertia-safe on `moveend`, never at `dragend`.
  //
  // The pinch case is the accepted cost and is smaller: the camera lands on the
