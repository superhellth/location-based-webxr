/**
 * App shell: builds the store, the pipeline and the views, and wires them.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY THIN, AND NOW THINNER. Everything that can be wrong in an
 * interesting way lives in `demo-pipeline.ts` (data), `refresh-cycle.ts` (the
 * async cycle and its two failure kinds), `osm-store.ts` (shared state) and
 * `heat-colours.ts` (presentation of an unbounded quantity) — all pure, all
 * unit-tested. This file is DOM plumbing, and it is short on purpose: when the
 * demo misbehaves, the question should be answerable without reading it.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED WITH THE STORE. The views used to be driven imperatively from one
 * `doRefresh`, in a fixed order, inside one `try`. They are now subscribers:
 * nothing here decides who draws first, and each view's failure is reported as
 * its own rather than as "the refresh failed" (see `refresh-cycle.ts`).
 *
 * WHAT THIS DEMO IS FOR — three questions no test suite can answer, and one it
 * can only answer on real data:
 *
 * 1. Is `AFFORDANCE_RES = 13` (4.09 m edge) the right grain? Too coarse and a
 *    footpath vanishes; too fine and the grid is noise.
 * 2. Are the unbounded scores practically thresholdable? See `heat-colours.ts`.
 * 3. Do regions land in the right PLACES? The arithmetic has been verified
 *    against the C# oracle; the geography has not.
 * 4. Does the mesh layer produce sane buildings from real footprints?
 *
 * @see main.ts.md

   * - `data-ground-centre` must FOLLOW the user. Without this counterweight

   *
   * Attributes rather than a `window` global: this app already uses `data-*` to

      // left the transition unowned again the moment a second dispatcher
      // appeared. Raised in review on #254.

      // not refetch (the rule is one-way) and dispatches nothing that replaces
      // the snapshot, so the held array survives. Without this an off/on flick
      // within one position pays a whole progressive refresh -- three rings, a
      // worker mesh build, up to 18 s -- to arrive at data already in hand,
      // where before stage B it was an instant redraw.

      // AT THE CALL SITE rather than inside `needsRefetch`, which keeps the
