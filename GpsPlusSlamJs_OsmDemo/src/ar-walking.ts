/**
 * Walking while an AR session is live — when to refetch, and when to warn.
 *
 * **THE FAILURE THIS MODULE EXISTS TO PREVENT IS SILENT WORK** (plan §2.6). The
 * demo has no GPS→position path today; every position change comes from the
 * map, and `positionChanged` fires `loadTerrain` and `refresh` on each one with
 * no gate. Wiring the framework's GPS watch in looks like one line, and that
 * line starves the cycle: `refresh` is `latestOnly`, so a new run aborts the one
 * in flight. At 1 Hz against a 15–90 s pass, every run is aborted by the next
 * and **nothing ever publishes** — no error, no empty state, just a view that
 * never changes while the worker runs flat out.
 *
 * So there are two conditions, and the gate is closed by EITHER: the user has
 * not moved far enough, or a pass is already running.
 *
 * **THE GATE MUST COVER `loadTerrain` TOO, WITH THE SAME POSITION**, and that
 * is a correctness requirement rather than symmetry. The worker joins the
 * terrain and the mesh build on EXACT lat/lng equality — right today, because
 * both numbers come from the same store position. Under a 1 Hz watch every fix
 * is a fresh double, so an ungated `loadTerrain` running on the newest position
 * while a gated `refresh` runs on an older one leaves `needsTerrainFor`
 * permanently true, and every build waits out the full 15 s terrain timeout
 * before drawing on whatever field it happens to hold. Gate both with one
 * position, or relax the join — and relaxing it is the worse of the two.

/**
 * How far the user must walk before AR refetches, metres.
 *
 * **BOUNDED FROM BOTH SIDES, and the bounds are what the tests pin** — the
 * number itself is a choice inside them.
 *
 * - **Above ~30 m**, because an urban GPS fix wanders 10–30 m while the phone
 *   sits still, and a threshold inside that band means a stationary user pays
 *   for a full 21 MB fetch and a re-scored working set over and over.
 *   **The cost is waste, NOT starvation** — an earlier version of this comment
 *   said starvation and was wrong (r509 review). `passInFlight` makes
 *   starvation impossible at ANY threshold, which is precisely what that flag
 *   buys; overstating the bound here would be the argument a future reader used
 *   to decide the flag was redundant.
 * - **Below the scored reach minus a worst-case pass**, because a refresh
 *   triggered after D metres lands 1.4·T metres later at walking pace, so the
 *   user is `D + 1.4·T` from the last scored centre when the data arrives — at
 *   the 90 s worst case, `D + 126`. Past the reach they are standing outside
 *   the scored disc entirely.
 *   - The reach is `SCORE_DISK_MAX_RADIUS`-derived and **has moved**: ~250 m at
 *     radius 4, ~326 m since DEC-K1 raised it to 6. So the bound on D went from
 *     ~124 m to ~200 m and 100 m has MORE headroom than when it was chosen, not
 *     less. Stated because the old figure was written in as a literal here and
 *     in the test, and a stale reach in a safety derivation is wrong even when
 *     it errs on the safe side — the next person to widen this would be
 *     reasoning from the wrong number.
 *
 * 100 m is ~71 s of walking. **DESIGNED AGAINST THE 90 s END, not against a
 * "typical" pass** — `resolutions.ts` measured 15.1 / 32.9 / 82.9 / 91.1 s for
 * four fetches and says outright that "a single latency quoted here is quoting
 * noise", with three previous retractions on record for exactly this pattern.
 * An earlier version of this comment called 15 s typical; it is the fastest of
 * four.
