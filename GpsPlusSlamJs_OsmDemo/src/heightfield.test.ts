/**
 * The terrain heightfield.
 *
 * Why these tests matter:
 * The status line reported "guessed heights" and the ground was a flat plane at
 * y = 0, which read as "it knows the elevation and just is not drawing it"
 * (finding M13). It does not — no elevation provider was wired at all. Wiring
 * one has three ways to go quietly wrong, and each is asserted here.
 *
 * 1. **`undefined` is not `0`.** A DEM tile that fails to load must never drop
 *    the ground to sea level under the buildings. That is the one failure that
 *    looks like data rather than like an error.
 * 2. **It must be RELATIVE.** The provider returns orthometric height —
 *    ~50 m at Cologne — while the mesh frame puts the user at y = 0. Feeding
 *    absolute metres straight in lifts the whole city off the camera.
 * 3. **The sampler is synchronous.** `buildBuildings` takes a plain
 *    `groundHeightM(position)`, so the fetching has to be finished before the
 *    mesh build starts, not interleaved with it.
 *
