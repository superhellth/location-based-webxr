/**
 * The map's attribution line: a short name per source, full credits behind an
 * expander.
 *
 * WHY THE DEMO OWNS THIS INSTEAD OF USING LEAFLET'S (round three, G5/F5).
 * `Control.Attribution._update` finishes by assigning `innerHTML` on its own
 * container, and it runs on every `addAttribution`/`removeAttribution` — which
 * `MapView.setTerrainAttribution` calls on every terrain apply, repeatedly
 * during normal use. An expander injected into that control, and its listener,
 * would be destroyed mid-session at random, resetting an expanded state for no
 * reason the user could see. Leaflet exposes no hook that survives it, so the
 * choice is between owning the control and not having an expander.
 *
 * WHAT MAY AND MAY NOT COLLAPSE (DEC-W1). Every source keeps a VISIBLE short
 * name; only the long credit text moves behind the tap. ODbL requires the OSM
 * credit wherever the data is shown, and this repo records the two elevation
 * credits as required "the same as the OSM one" — so hiding any of them behind
 * a tap would answer a licence question in the opposite direction to the answer
 * already written into `map-view.ts` and `main.ts`. The owner asked for "one
 * word per attribution" in a thin line; one short name each IS that, which is
 * why the request and the obligation turned out to be the same design rather
 * than a compromise between two.
 *
 * Thin on purpose, like `legend-view.ts`: this file is DOM and nothing else.
 * The Leaflet wiring lives in `map-view.ts`, which is also the only place that
 * knows a map exists.
 *
 * @see attribution-view.ts.md
