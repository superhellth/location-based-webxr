/**
 * Why these tests matter: this is a coordinate transform, and the fifteenth
 * session's review made the point that a transform pinned only by examples can
 * agree with a wrong implementation. The specific failure here is a beacon that
 * looks entirely reasonable and stands somewhere the quest is not — the same
 * class of bug `ar-scene-hierarchy.ts` records two independent readers hitting.
 *
 * The second failure this guards is subtler and was found by the plan's cold
 * review: `heightAt` CLAMPS outside its window rather than refusing, so a quest
 * beyond the sampled terrain would be given fabricated relief that reads as a
 * measurement.
