/**
 * A zeroed `DemoStageTimings`, for tests that build a `DemoSnapshot` by hand.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A LITERAL IN EACH TEST. `DemoSnapshot.timings` is
 * REQUIRED (see `demo-pipeline.ts`), because `update` is its only producer and
 * always measures — an optional field could only ever mean "a future path
 * dropped it silently". The cost of that decision is that every hand-built
 * snapshot fixture needs all of the fields, and two test files build one. A
 * shared constant keeps the field list in one place, so adding a stage is one
 * edit rather than a hunt.
 *
 * **Zeros are honest HERE and nowhere else.** These fixtures belong to tests
 * about the store and the refresh cycle, which are not about timing at all; a
 * pass that genuinely measured nothing is exactly what they should carry. A
 * test that asserts anything about timings must build its own numbers — see
 * `pipeline-timings.test.ts`.
 *
 * @see snapshot-timings-fixture.ts.md
