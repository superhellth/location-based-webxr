/**
 * Where the sun is, as a physical position rather than as a function of the
 * camera (§1, DEC-R6-3).
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND WHY THE OLD ANSWER WAS RIGHT AT THE TIME. `sun.ts`
 * made the sun's AZIMUTH follow the camera's with a fixed 45° offset, so the
 * lighting relationship was constant as the eye orbited and a specular highlight
 * on the reflective ground was never lost (DEC-R4-6). That solved a real
 * complaint — _"wenn man aus dem richtigen Winkel guckt, sieht man schön die
 * Detailunterschiede, aber das ist meistens einfach nicht der Fall"_ — and it
 * worked because the sky was a painted texture that could simply be rotated to
 * match.
 *
 * WHY IT CANNOT SURVIVE §1. The sky is now three's `Sky` shader, a real
 * atmospheric-scattering model whose horizon glow, colour and brightness are all
 * derived from the sun's actual position. A sun that follows the camera makes
 * that entire sky rotate as you pan: the glow slides along the horizon and the
 * whole world reads as broken rather than as lit. The two are incompatible, and
 * DEC-R6-3 chose the physical sun.
 *
 * WHAT PAYS FOR THE REVERSAL. Two things, and they are the reason this is not
 * simply a regression:
 *
 * - **§2's slope treatment does not depend on the light direction at all.**
 *   Contour lines of constant steepness are visible from every azimuth, so the
 *   relief DEC-R4-6 was protecting is now carried by geometry rather than by a
 *   highlight. That is why the two stages are coupled: if §2 slips, this should
 *   slip with it.
 * - **A physical sun is what makes the environment map affordable.**
 *   `PMREMGenerator.fromScene` is a render pass; under a camera-following sun it
 *   would run on every drag, which is exactly the per-frame cost DEC-R3-9's
 *   on-demand renderer exists to avoid. A sun that only moves when the user
 *   changes the time runs it on a deliberate action and never otherwise.
 *
 * THE COMPASS CONVENTION IS THE ONE THING TO GET RIGHT. Azimuth is measured
 * **clockwise from north**, and north is the render frame's **−z** (the same
 * convention `mesh-data.ts` and `cell-mesh.ts` use). `sun.ts` measured from `+z`
 * instead, which was internally consistent but is not what a user means by
 * "azimuth" — and this value is about to become a user-facing control.
 *
