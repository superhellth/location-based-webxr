 * constraint"; "the Y-baseline jump will be visible"; "nothing will z-fight";
 * "the alignment will look good enough to be pleasant and not good enough to
 * measure") and the plan is explicit that they are stated so they can be wrong
 * in public. None of them can be checked from a desk: they need a phone, in a
 * street, showing its own numbers.
 *
 * The desktop status line already reports draw cost — and it reports
 * `BuildingView`'s renderer, which is **not the one AR draws with**. The
 * framework's session builds a second `WebGLRenderer`, and `renderer.info` is
 * per-renderer, so the number on screen during a session would describe a
 * renderer that is not producing the frames. The plan names this outright:
 * "Needs a draw-cost readout on the AR renderer, which does not exist."
 *
 * **PURE, for the same reason `draw-cost.ts` is**: `renderer.info` needs a
 * `WebGLRenderer`, so the values come from the caller and the SENTENCE is built
 * here, where it can be pinned without a GPU.
