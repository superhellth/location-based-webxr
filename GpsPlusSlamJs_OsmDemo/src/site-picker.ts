/**
 * The example-location picker (W5, R4-1, DEC-R4-11).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The demo opened at Cologne and the only ways to leave were a
 * hand-edited `?lat=&lng=` and the geolocation button — so for three rounds it
 * was looked at in one place, which is the condition that produced the round-3
 * cathedral finding: a defect that could not be reproduced because there was
 * nowhere else to look.
 *
 * WHY IT READS `PICKER_PLACES` AND NOT THE PACKAGE'S CORPUS TABLE (DEC-R6b-1).
 * It used to read the corpus, because two lists drift and the drift's cost is
 * that the places a human can reach stop being the places the suite covers. The
 * sixth session made that untenable: a corpus site earns its place by being
 * **awkward to render**, and several are deliberately unphotogenic — the owner
 * asked for a dropdown of famous places instead.
 *
 * **The anti-drift guarantee moved rather than disappeared.** Every corpus site
 * stays reachable through `?site=<id>`, which `start-position.test.ts` asserts
 * for the whole table; the dropdown is free to list what a visitor wants to
 * click. Reachability rather than membership is what lets "Sylt auf jeden Fall
 * raus" and "the tested places stay visitable" both be true.
 *
 * WHY IT REPORTS A POSITION RATHER THAN DOING ANYTHING. Choosing a site is the
 * same intent as clicking the map and the same intent as the locate button: the
 * user is saying where they are. All three therefore go through ONE action, so
 * there is no second refresh path that could disagree with the first — the rule
 * `LocateControl` already follows.
 *
 * WHY THE CHOICE COSTS A COLD FETCH, and that is accepted rather than hidden
 * (DEC-R4-11): the picker moves the user and the ordinary pipeline fetches. A
 * first visit to a site is an 18-110 s res-7 Overpass fetch; every later visit
 * is served from OPFS. Loading the committed offline extract instead was
 * offered and rejected — the demo would be showing fixture data while looking
 * identical to live data, which is the "two claims that look the same" defect
 * this project keeps removing.
 *
