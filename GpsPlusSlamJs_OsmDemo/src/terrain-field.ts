/**
 * The terrain cache: one growing lattice of height posts, sampled once each.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (DEC-R2-21, replacing the fixed square of DEC-15/W8). The
 * previous design sampled a square centred on the user and re-sampled **all of
 * it** on every position change — at the rendered extent that is ~55 000 posts
 * discarded and recomputed per step. Tolerable for clicking around a map, wrong
 * for the actual use case, which is walking. Here a post is fetched once and
 * reused for as long as it stays near the user, so movement costs only the new
 * edge.
 *
 * WHY A LATTICE RATHER THAN TILES. DEC-R2-21 asked for "tiled, cached,
 * ring-loaded" and named tile seams as the risk that design introduced. A single
 * global lattice with a sparse post map has the same three properties and **makes
 * the seam unrepresentable**: there is one grid, so there is no boundary between
 * two grids for a discontinuity to live on. Fewer moving parts, and one whole
 * failure mode removed rather than tested for.
 *
 * WHY THE LATTICE IS WEB MERCATOR PIXELS AT THE TERRARIUM ZOOM. Two reasons, and
 * both matter:
 *
 *  - **It is the DEM's own sampling grid.** Every post lands on a source pixel
 *    centre, so nothing is resampled and no detail is invented. Sampling finer
 *    than the source buys interpolated pixels and nothing else.
 *  - **It is global and does not move.** An ENU grid is anchored at the user, so
 *    it shifts with every step and no post is ever reusable — which is precisely
 *    the flaw being fixed. Pixel indices are absolute.
 *
 * WHAT STILL CROSSES THE WORKER BOUNDARY. Not the lattice — it grows without a
 * fixed size. `sampleGrid` renders a bounded, fixed-shape `HeightfieldData` over
 * the current view, exactly the type the boundary already carried, so the protocol
 * is unchanged and the incremental win is entirely worker-side.
 *
