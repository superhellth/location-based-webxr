/**
 * The demo's monotonic millisecond clock.
 *
 * WHY IT IS SHARED RATHER THAN PRIVATE. It began as a local in
 * `demo-pipeline.ts` for the geo-event timings; the click-path breakdown then
 * needed the same clock in the worker handler and on the page, and three copies
 * of a `typeof performance === "undefined"` guard is three places for the
 * fallback to drift.
 *
 * **MONOTONIC, and that word is load-bearing.** `Date.now()` steps backwards on
 * an NTP correction, and a res-7 fetch measured in tens of seconds is exactly
 * the window where that lands. A negative duration in a stage breakdown is
 * worse than a wrong one: the reconciliation sums the stages against a wall
 * clock, so a negative makes the sum close by CANCELLING and the one gate that
 * would catch a clock problem goes quiet precisely when it should shout.
 *
 * The `Date.now` fallback is for a runtime with no `performance` global — some
 * test environments. Durations are reported in whole milliseconds, so the two
 * clocks agree well within the reporting resolution; what matters is that a
 * missing global cannot throw inside the path being measured.
 *
 * @see monotonic-clock.ts.md

/**
 * An ABSOLUTE epoch-millisecond reading from the monotonic clock.
 *
 * `performance.timeOrigin` is the epoch time at which this context's `now()`
 * was zero, and it is exposed on the page AND inside a dedicated worker — so
 * `timeOrigin + now()` is a timeline BOTH SIDES SHARE, unlike `now()` alone,
 * which is relative to a different origin in each.
 *
 * **Use it only where an absolute origin is genuinely needed.** Today that is
 * two things: the worker queue wait (post → dispatch), a cross-boundary
 * comparison no single-sided duration can express; and the diagnostics notes
 * (`recordDiagnostic` in `main.ts`), timestamps that OUTLIVE the page — read
 * back months later out of a recording zip, where only an epoch value can be
 * placed on the session timeline. Everything else stays a duration measured
 * wholly on one side, because that needs no shared origin and cannot be wrong
 * about one.
 *
 * **It is coarse, deliberately.** Browsers round `now()` and `timeOrigin` to
 * defend against timing attacks — typically 0.1–1 ms outside a cross-origin-
 * isolated context. Fine against a queue wait of tens of milliseconds; not fine
 * for a sub-millisecond stage, which is the other reason this is not the
 * default route.
