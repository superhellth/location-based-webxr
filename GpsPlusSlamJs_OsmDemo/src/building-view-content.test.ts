/**
 * Guardrail: map-derived content is routed through `this.content`, not to the
 * scene directly.
 *
 * WHY A SOURCE-TEXT TEST, which is unusual and is the point. `scene-content.ts`
 * names one failure mode twice — *"an edit that attaches AR-relevant content
 * straight to `BuildingView`'s scene leaves it behind, and the symptom is
 * content missing in AR while every desktop test stays green"* — and the first
 * version of this milestone guarded it nowhere. It cannot be guarded at
 * runtime: `BuildingView` constructs a `THREE.WebGLRenderer`, so the unit suite
 * cannot instantiate it, and the desktop e2e passes either way BY DEFINITION —
 * on desktop both parents render identically. The defect is invisible until AR
 * runs, which is the definition of a thing that needs a static check.
 *
 * Precedent in this workspace for reading source as text rather than importing
 * it: `agent-loop-config.test.ts`, `retracted-osm-figures-in-docs.test.ts`,
 * `internal-subpath-guardrail.test.ts` and `ip-guardrail.test.ts`.
 *
 * What it does NOT do: decide whether a given object *should* be AR content.
 * That is a judgement recorded in `scene-content.ts` against plan §2.8. This
 * only makes the split explicit, so adding a fifth object to the scene is a
 * deliberate act with a red gate attached rather than an oversight.
 *
 * @see scene-content.ts.md
