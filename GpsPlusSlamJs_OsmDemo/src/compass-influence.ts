/**
 * The 0–1 compass influence, mapped to the settings that actually produce it
 * (DEC-E2).
 *
 * **WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT A LINE IN AN EVENT HANDLER.** "Influence 0"
 * does not mean "vote weight 0". `compass-steady-state.ts` computes
 * `clamp01((1 − obs) + obs·trust·weight)`, so at `weight = 0` the result is
 * **`1 − observability`** — a *full* compass override whenever yaw is poorly
 * observable, which is exactly when someone would reach for the slider. And
 * turning the rotation prior off does not help either: that falls through to the
 * **cold-start override**, whose curve is identical and which has been default
 * **on** since 2026-07-25.
 *
 * So a genuine zero needs **three** settings, and getting it wrong ships a
 * slider whose zero end still lets the compass drive — invisible from the UI,
 * and visible here.
 *
 * **WHY THE EXPERIMENT COMBO IS PART OF NON-ZERO INFLUENCE.** The steady-state
 * term is multiplied by `trustScalar`, which is `0` unless the trust state is
 * exactly `trusted`. The §6a field corpus measured per-session compass↔GPS
 * offsets of **−4.3…+18.8°** against a default `compassTrustAgreeToleranceDeg`
 * of **8**, which "rarely activates trust on real devices". There is no
 * standalone runtime setter for that tolerance — the only way to reach it is
 * `setCompassExperimentEnabled`, whose combo pins it to **15°**. Without it this
 * slider is identically inert at every position while walking, which is not a
 * control, it is a decoration.
 *
 * The combo maps `useCompassRotationPrior`, the tolerance and pair selection —
 * and **not** the vote weight, which `gpsDataSlice` maps afterwards and
 * unconditionally. Verified rather than assumed: the slider's value survives the
 * combo.
 *
 * Pure on purpose, like `elevation-nudge.ts`: the mapping is the part worth
 * testing and it should be testable without a store, a session or a DOM.
