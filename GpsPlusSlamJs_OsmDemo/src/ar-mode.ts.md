# `ar-mode.ts`

## Purpose

Starts a WebXR session, hands the already-built city to the framework's scene
graph in the right frame, subscribes the world group to the fusion's alignment,
and gives the city back on the way out.

## Scope — AR milestones 1 to 5

**In:** the session lifecycle, the attachment, the alignment subscription, the
scene environment and camera planes, the measurement sampler, and teardown of
all of it on both the app-initiated and system-initiated exits.

**Out:** nothing, now that milestones 3 to 5 have landed. This file starts the
session and owns what the session owns: the attachment, the alignment, the
environment, the measurement sampler, and teardown of all of it on both exits.
The distance gate lives in [`ar-walk-controller.ts`](ar-walk-controller.ts.md),
the readout in [`ar-hud.ts`](ar-hud.ts.md), and the desktop renderer's suspend/
resume in `building-view.ts` — each called from here or from `main.ts`.

**M2 lives in [`ar-scene-environment.ts`](ar-scene-environment.ts.md), not
here**, and is only _called_ from here. This demo has a recorded history of a
wrong scene environment making every `MeshStandardMaterial` **fail to compile
and silently not draw for ten work items while every assertion stayed green**,
so the rule against setting one is stated and tested in a module a reader can
point at, rather than being an absence in this file that nobody notices. The
camera planes moved there with it: fog has to end exactly at the far plane, so
the two are one decision.

## Public API

- `ArModeDeps` — `{ container, store, buildingView, origin, sceneAnchor, enuFrameAt, onError, onEnded?, autoElevation?, … }`.
  - `autoElevation` — **presence IS the switch** for the automatic elevation
    offset (plan §2.6). `main.ts` omits the whole group when the URL kill
    switch (`?autoElevation=off`) is set; with it absent this module requests
    no depth sensing, builds no grid and ticks no estimator — the session is
    byte-identical to the pre-auto behaviour, which is what makes the kill
    switch a real field A/B. Its `terrainHeightM` is the AR-datum-gated DEM
    sampler (`terrainReadout`'s height — the same two gates the HUD's terrain
    line uses).
  - `store` is the INTERSECTION `TrackingSubscribableStore & SubscribableStore`, because `initAR` and the alignment wiring want different `getState` shapes and neither subsumes the other. Stated as an intersection rather than as the concrete `SlamAppStore`, whose shape changes with the demo's `extraReducers`.
  - `sceneAnchor` and `enuFrameAt` are how the city's own ENU origin is reconciled with the GPS one. The mesh is authored about the demo's anchor and the GPS-world frame is about `zero`; without the offset the city renders at the right orientation and the wrong place.
  - `origin` is the framework's `zero`, read by the caller. `null` means no fix.
  - `onEstimateEngaged?(afterS)` — **an instrument, not a feature** (owner
    decision, 2026-08-23). Called ONCE per session, with seconds since the
    session's first frame, when the elevation estimator first engages.
    - **Why it exists:** DEC-L2 stretched the entry fly-in to 12 s partly so the
      auto-elevation correction lands underneath it, and that argument turns on
      how long engagement takes **while a user stands still** — never measured,
      and **unmeasurable here**: the estimator's confidence is built from depth
      observations that need motion, so every fixture that reaches an engaged
      state does so by walking. See
      `GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-08-21-1120-ar-entry-gate-fallback-may-be-the-normal-path-followup.md`.
    - **Its absence is also a measurement:** no call in a whole session means
      the estimator never engaged, which is the outcome that followup considers
      most likely.
    - **Relative to the first frame, not to `elapsed`**, which is page-relative.
      A stamp that forgot to subtract would grow with how long the tab had been
      open — the same trap the fps sampler and the descent clock document, and
      the test walks from a page clock of 30 s precisely so it can fail on it.
    - **Latched on its own flag**, because engagement is hysteretic: keying off
      `engaged` alone would re-announce every boundary crossing.
    - `main.ts` renders it as an AR toast rather than a console line: the
      measurement is taken in the field, where a console needs a cable.
  - `entryContentReady?()` — whether the AR entry rebuild has settled (DEC-M1).
    The entry veil holds until it says yes, so the user never meets the city
    built for the DESKTOP datum, ~100 m out. **A getter, read per frame**: the
    pass it reports on is started by the caller AFTER `startArMode` resolves, so
    nothing readable at construction can answer it. **Absent means "nothing to
    wait for"**, the convention `estimateReady` already uses for an absent
    estimator, so an un-wired caller is not silently held to the ceiling.
  - `onEntryReady?({ afterS, aligned, contentReady })` — **an instrument, not a
    feature** (DEC-M1a), beside `onEstimateEngaged` and for the same reason:
    `ENTRY_READY_MAX_WAIT_S` is a guess, and both flags travel with the time
    because the time alone cannot distinguish "ready at 2 s" from "gave up at
    8 s".

## The entry sequence (DEC-M1, DEC-M2, DEC-M3)

One state machine, stated once, because four separate decisions depend on it and
the plan's first draft described them as independent one-line edits — which the
cold review showed would have left a permanently opaque sphere.

1. **`firstFrameS`** latches at the top of the frame callback. Every wait in the
   entry is measured from it, and it is page-relative `elapsed` minus nothing
   else — a session entered thirty seconds after load sees its first frame at
   `elapsed ≈ 30`.
2. **`aligned`** = `arWorldGroup.matrix` is not identity, computed at the top of
   the callback whatever the estimator configuration. It used to live inside the
   `auto !== undefined` block; with `?autoElevation=off` that copy never ran,
   and the veil would have waited out its ceiling on every entry.
3. **The DOM veil fades** once `framesSinceVeil >= 2` (the unchanged sub-frame
   race) AND `entryFadeMayStart` opens: the hold, the alignment and the content
   readiness, or the ceiling. It is removed when its own alpha reaches 0.
4. **The fly-in starts** on the first frame where the DOM veil is GONE and
   `descentMayStart` agrees. The two waits run concurrently, so the estimate's
   3 s costs nothing extra in the common case.
5. **The sphere holds at fully opaque for the whole fly-in**, then fades over
   `ENTRY_VEIL_FADE_S`. The landing announces itself (`onDescentComplete`, latched
   on `descentDone`) but does **not** dispose the sphere.
6. **The descent clock is cleared where the sphere is disposed**, i.e. when its
   alpha reaches 0 — not at the landing. Clearing it there while the alpha still
   held at 1 is exactly how this would leave a lid over the passthrough.
7. **Teardown disposes both veils unconditionally**, the backstop for every path
   that never reaches step 6.

- `startArMode(deps): Promise<ArMode>` — **never rejects.** A refused session,
  an unsupported device and a missing GPS fix are ordinary outcomes the page
  renders, not exceptions; all of them reach the user through `onError` and
  return an inert handle.
  - **The promise is guarded END TO END, since 2026-08-18** (PR #316 review).
    Only the `initAR` call used to sit inside a `try`; everything from the
    elevation attach to `bootCompleted = true` ran unguarded, so the contract
    was nearly true rather than true. A throw there left the worst state this
    module can reach — session LIVE, city already reparented so the desktop map
    is empty with nothing to give it back, `bootCompleted` still `false` so
    `onSessionEnd` returns early and `release()` never runs — surfacing only as
    an **unhandled rejection**, because `main.ts` calls this as
    `void startArMode(...).then(...)` with no `.catch`. No toast, no
    `onError`, and the button still reading "Enter AR".
  - The recovery path reuses `release(true)`, the same teardown a normal exit
    takes, rather than unwinding by hand — which is what stops the partial-boot
    path drifting away from the working one.
- `ArMode` — `{ started, dispose() }`, idempotent. **Drive UI from `started`,
  not from "a handle came back":** a handle always comes back, an inert one on a
  refused permission. Treating that as a live session showed the user an error
  toast and an "Exit AR" button at the same time.

## Invariants & assumptions

- **Entry is gated on a first GPS fix, BEFORE `initAR`.** The origin is the
  framework's `zero`, `null` until a fix lands, and DEC-R11-6 rejected
  re-anchoring on the first non-null `zero` — so entering early and correcting
  later is not available. Checking before `initAR` also avoids prompting for
  camera permission and then refusing to draw anything.
- **The content goes on the SCENE ROOT, not on `arWorldGroup`.** The root IS
  the GPS-world frame, so map-derived content built once belongs there with no
  inverse-alignment container; the lerped alignment on `arWorldGroup` moves the
  CAMERA through a world that stands still. Two independent readers previously
  concluded the opposite, which is why `ar-scene-hierarchy.ts` states it at the
  top of the file.
- **`"gps-world-nue"` is not optional.** The demo's scene is X=East, Y=Up,
  Z=−North; the root is NUE. Attaching without it renders the city 90° off. See
  `scene-content.ts`.
- **ONE `release(endSession)` for both exits, and this is load-bearing for the
  milestones that follow.** `onSessionEnd` fires for the Android back gesture as
  well as for our own `endARSession`, so both paths reach the same function and
  it is idempotent. The single difference is a parameter: the system-end path
  must NOT call `endARSession()` on a session that is already ending.
  - An earlier version split it — `teardown()` re-attached the content while
    `dispose()` additionally released the alignment handle. That worked **by
    accident**: the only thing `dispose()` added was a handle the framework
    already reclaims via `runSessionDisposers()` before invoking `onSessionEnd`.
    **M2, M4 and M5 each add cleanup here** (the environment and camera planes,
    the draw-cost readout, the desktop renderer), and every one of them would
    have silently not run on the back gesture. **M2 has since landed and is the
    first to prove the point** — `session.restoreEnvironment` is released here,
    and a test pins that it runs on the system end specifically.
  - Content must come back whichever way the session ends: the framework
    **discards** its scene at session end, so content still attached to it is
    content the desktop view no longer has and nothing reclaims — and three.js
    reports nothing, so the symptom is an empty map view.
    - **The environment restore is a different case and a weaker one.** The
      framework rebuilds scene, camera and renderer on every `initAR`, so
      nothing there can leak into a later session; that restore is hygiene for a
      caller passing objects it does not own, not protection of shared state. An
      earlier version of this file claimed otherwise (r508 review) — the code
      was right, the reason was not.
- **`bootCompleted` guards a session that ends during a failed boot.** The
  scene-not-ready bail-out calls `endARSession`, which fires `onSessionEnd`,
  which must not run teardown against half-built state.
- **No camera or hit-test features** (both default ON): the city's position
  comes from GPS, not vision. **Depth-sensing follows the `autoElevation`
  switch** — the floor estimator needs the depth stream, so with the dep
  present the flag is on, the framework sampler is started at the
  reconstruction cadence (`AR_DEPTH_SAMPLER_CONFIG`), and every captured
  sample folds directly into the session's `ar-depth-pipeline.ts` grid (no
  store hop — the demo records nothing).
  - **The depth-texture near/far override is NOT in play here, and that is a
    verified fact** (cold-review F1 removed an inert per-frame re-assertion
    guard): three.js takes `depthNear`/`depthFar` from a depth texture only
    in **gpu-optimized** depth sessions, and the framework pins
    `usagePreference: ['cpu-optimized']` (`permission-checker.ts`, asserted
    by its own test); three also never writes near/far back onto the app's
    camera object, so the removed guard's condition was unreachable and its
    test could only pass by mutating the camera by hand. The **M5 field
    check** is now simply: confirm no clip/fog anomaly with depth sensing on
    (see `ar-depth-pipeline.ts.md`).
  - **The grid is cleared AND the auto estimator is reset in the same
    `onRestarted` callback that re-bases the odometry** (plan §2.4;
    cold-review F2 added the reset): stale cells from a dead odometry frame
    produce a plausible-looking, wrong floor inside the estimator's
    acceptance band, and the estimator's own window holds samples from the
    same dead frame — its hold branch would keep publishing a dead-frame
    value for up to 45 s while the cleared grid refills. One callback, so
    the clear, the reset and the dispatch cannot drift apart.
- **The applied elevation is `composeElevationM(appliedAutoM, manualTrimM)` —
  one composition, one channel.** The auto estimator (`ar-elevation-auto.ts`,
  ticked ~1 Hz from the frame loop with the live alignment and
  `getCurrentArPose`) and the manual ± control both land on the same
  `applyElevation` path; a null auto target contributes zero, so the buttons
  behave exactly as before the feature existed. The auto state also feeds the
  HUD's `auto` line beside the raw `above terrain` residual — the pair is the
  M5 instrument (`ar-measurements.ts`).
  - **Only an ENGAGED auto value reaches the content** (cold-review F1). The
    eased target is `latestAuto.engaged ? autoM : 0`, never the published
    value alone: the framework estimators report and the caller gates, and a
    stream of crushed floor estimates still publishes an `offsetM` at a
    confidence of hundredths (`ar-elevation-auto.ts.md` has the mechanism).
    Both thresholds and the hysteresis live in `ar-elevation-auto.ts`; this
    module only reads `engaged`. The HUD's `auto` line carries `autoEngaged`
    so it can say `low` rather than imply the city moved.
  - **The applied auto value is EASED, the manual trim is instant**
    (cold-review F4; DEC-E1). `appliedAutoM` glides toward the gated target
    at `AUTO_APPLY_RATE_M_PER_S` (1.5 m/s, 3× the estimator's slew
    rate) per frame, so the cold-start first value and each 1 Hz step reach
    the content as an ease, never a one-frame step — and a reset/kill, or a
    RELEASE of the confidence gate, eases back to zero the same way. The
    split is deliberate: a measured signal must arrive gently, an owner
    override must obey immediately. The HUD shows the estimator's PUBLISHED
    value; the application catches up to it within a second or two.
  - **`geometricOffset` doubles as the estimator's `anchorOffsetNue`**, so the
    frame the city is attached in and the frame hits are compared in cannot
    disagree.
- **Frame note for future consumers (plan §2.6):** the offset moves the CITY
  SUBTREE only. Anything anchored in the GPS-world frame **outside** that
  subtree — framework `GpsAnchor` consumers, the AnchorStarter pattern — will
  disagree with the corrected city by exactly `autoM + manualTrimM`. Harmless
  today (only the city is reparented); a 6–7 m surprise for the first feature
  that places an object beside it.
- **Far-field limitation of the auto offset (known, accepted):** the
  correction is a single scalar measured at the user's feet and applied to
  the whole city. On a slope where the DEM's error varies with position,
  buildings hundreds of metres upslope or downslope can end up WORSE than
  uncorrected — one measurement cannot serve two places whose DEM errors
  differ. A distance taper (full correction near the user, fading with
  range) is future work; see `ar-elevation-auto.ts.md`.
- **`getCamera() === null` bails the session out**, in the same guard as the
  scene rather than treated as optional. Continuing would leave the framework's
  `0.01 / 200` in place, clipping a 2.8 km mesh at 200 m with no error anywhere.
- **`tracking.onRestarted` re-bases the odometry, and became load-bearing on
  2026-08-14.** The framework calls it on a `lost → tracking` transition that
  reset ARCore's origin; with no callback the payload is dropped and every
  pre-restart odometry position stays in a frame that no longer exists, so the
  alignment solve mixes two incompatible frames. It was harmless while the demo
  dispatched no GPS events at all; the moment `gps-registration.ts` started
  feeding the coordinator it became the difference between a converging fit and
  a city that jumps once and never recovers — a failure that reads exactly like
  a broken fusion.
  - Worse, it fails _wrongly_ rather than absently: the framework substitutes a
    fabricated zero orientation when the device-orientation cache is empty, so
    without the orientation watch the restart payload carries a confident wrong
    rotation rather than a null one. Both are wired together for that reason.
- **Narrow framework subpaths, never the barrel** — the root export pulls in
  Leaflet, which touches `window` at import time. `osm-store.ts` carries the
  same note.
- **The manual elevation nudge is summed onto the geometric offset AT THE
  `attachContentTo` CALL SITE** (DEC-E1), never inside `sceneAnchorOffsetNue`.
  That function's `up: 0` is a guarded invariant with its own test, and folding a
  user fudge into it would double-count the geoid.
  - The offset is **added to** `geometricOffset`, not substituted for it.
    Dropping the north/east terms would put the city in the wrong country, which
    is why `ar-mode.test.ts` asserts the summed vector reaches
    `attachContentTo` rather than merely asserting the call happened.
  - The control is created, attached and disposed with the session, for the
    `#ar-root` reason recorded in `ar-elevation-control.ts.md`: that element is
    `position: fixed; inset: 0` and hidden only while `:empty`, so one left
    behind covers the whole page. Teardown is asserted here.
  - **AR only.** The desktop preview attaches with `demo-scene`, which sets
    identity and discards the offset entirely.
- **The compass slider is created only when `onCompassSettings` is supplied**,
  so a caller that cannot dispatch gets no control rather than a slider that
  silently does nothing.
  - `setReady(true)` is called **immediately**, and that is a fact rather than
    an assumption: every compass setter no-ops while the store's gps state is
    null, but AR entry is gated on `canEnterAr(origin)` and a non-null origin
    **is** the framework's `zero`. The control's own latch stays as the
    defensive path for a future caller that is not gated the same way.
  - Disposed in `release()` alongside the elevation control, for the `#ar-root`
    reason.
- **`fusedBearingDeg` is taken in WORLD space, and that is the subtlety.** The
  hierarchy is `scene (GPS-world NUE) → arWorldGroup (receives the alignment) →
basisChangeNode → arpose → camera`, so the camera is a **descendant** of the
  aligned group and its world transform already carries the alignment.
  - A direction taken **relative to `arWorldGroup`** would be in the AR-odometry
    frame — the alignment's _domain_, i.e. un-aligned — and would produce a
    plausible number that is not north. `ar-scene-hierarchy.ts` records two
    independent readers getting this backwards, and an earlier draft of the AR
    HUD review did too.
  - The axis convention lives in `ar-origin.ts`'s `nueBearingDeg` with its own
    cardinal-direction tests, rather than as an `atan2` at the call site.
  - Suppressed while the alignment matrix is still identity, on the same
    reasoning as `worldBaselineY`: an unmeasured bearing must not render as a
    confident `0°`.

## Examples

```ts
const mode = await startArMode({
  container: document.querySelector("#ar-root")!,
  store,
  buildingView,
  origin: selectZeroReference(store.getState()),
  onError: showError,
  onEnded: () => showMapView(),
});
// …later
mode.dispose();
```

## Tests

`ar-mode.test.ts`, with the framework's session module mocked (the reference
consumer `WayfindingHudDemo/src/ar-mode.test.ts` does the same — a real
`initAR` needs a WebXR device, and what this module owns is the wiring either
side of it).

Every failure this module can produce is silent, so each has an assertion: no
session without a fix; attachment to the scene root **and not** to
`arWorldGroup`; the frame argument present; the alignment subscription; the
feature flags off; the city not stranded when the scene is missing; the bail-out
when the camera is missing; the camera's planes actually widened; the city and
the scene environment returned on `dispose()` **and** on a system-initiated end;
and idempotent teardown, asserted as exactly two attachments rather than three.

The environment assertions are duplicated on purpose:
`ar-scene-environment.test.ts` proves the function is correct, and the ones here
prove it is **called**. M1 shipped three modules that were each correct in
isolation with nothing asserting they were connected, and four green gates
passed all three.

The auto-elevation wiring is split across two files because `vi.mock` is
file-wide: `ar-mode.test.ts` keeps the REAL `ar-depth-pipeline` and drives the
full fold → floor → offset chain to the one observable end (`attachContentTo`'s
`up`, the HUD's `auto` line, the trim composition, the pre-alignment null, the
application-time ease of the first value, the estimator reset on a tracking
restart, the kill-switch flag set, and the confidence gate — a standstill
stream never moves the content while the HUD tags it `low`, and a release
eases back to zero instead of snapping). Those tests WALK the alignment
because the estimator's novelty weighting deliberately deflates a standstill:
a stationary stream saturates near 0.1 confidence and never engages, so any
assertion about an applied auto value would hold vacuously without the walk.
`ar-mode.depth-wiring.test.ts` swaps in a
spy pipeline to pin the lifecycle wiring itself — every captured sample reaches
`fold`, `clear` runs in the same callback as the `odometryTrackingRestarted`
dispatch, and no pipeline exists without the dep.
