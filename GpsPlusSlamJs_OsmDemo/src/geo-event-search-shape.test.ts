/**
 * WHY THIS TEST MATTERS — it measures the two assumptions the geo-event
 * diagnosis rests on, and neither had ever been counted.
 *
 * The reported defect is that an event never lands on the Tower of London even
 * though `battleArea` scores very high there. The proposed explanation is that
 * the search is "throw ten darts, nudge each a few metres uphill, take the
 * best", which would find a big peak only if a dart landed almost on it. Two
 * claims carry that explanation:
 *
 * 1. **Round one almost always wins.** The quality gate is an absolute floor
 *    meaning roughly "is anything mapped here", so in a place with data every
 *    batch passes and the nine retry batches never run — 10 candidates are
 *    evaluated, not 100.
 * 2. **A climb travels far less than its 35 m ceiling.** `CLIMB_STEPS = 5` at a
 *    7.09 m res-13 spacing allows ~35 m, but greedy ascent stops at the first
 *    local maximum, and mapped ground is full of small ones.
 *
 * **If either is false the diagnosis is wrong**, and so is every fix built on
 * it. That is why this lands before any change.
 *
 * THE FIELD HAS TO HAVE A GRADIENT, which is the trap here. The existing
 * `wideSource` fixture is a single uniform park: every cell scores identically,
 * so a climb has nothing to climb and stops after one step **for a reason that
 * has nothing to do with the defect**. Measuring hypothesis 2 against it would
 * produce a confident "climbs do not travel" that was really "there was no
 * hill". So this builds a graded field — a low background, scattered small
 * bumps, and one large high peak — which is the shape the real complaint is
 * about.
