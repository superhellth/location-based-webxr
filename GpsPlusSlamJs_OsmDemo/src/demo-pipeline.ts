 * the unbounded thresholds practically pickable, do regions land in the right

    // The app downloads in RES-7 UNITS, each covering seven event tiles, so
    // several neighbours are usually already in memory. Those are free; the
    // rest are skipped.
    //
    // "FREE" MEANS THE WHOLE SEARCH AREA, not the tile's centre — and that
    // distinction was wrong here for several rounds. See the gate below.
    //
    // **THIS DOES NOT WEAKEN DEC-R9-4, and the distinction is the whole
    // justification.** Every tile's event stays a pure function of (tile, time)
    // — identical on every device, forever. What varies with what you have
    // downloaded is only WHICH of them you can currently see. Two people who
    // walk to the same place find the same event; a device that has loaded more
    // discovers more of them, and they converge. The divergence is "you have not
    // loaded that area yet", not "we disagree about where the event is".
    // **THE GATE IS THE NEIGHBOUR'S REACH, NOT ITS CENTRE**, and the difference
    // is the whole point of the paragraph above. It used to ask whether
    // `toFetchTile(neighbour)` was loaded — the tile the neighbour's CENTRE
    // falls in. But the ensure set built for that neighbour below extends
    // `CLIMB_STEPS + 1` cells past each of its candidates, and its candidates
    // are seeded across its whole bounding box: ~550 m past the centre, into
    // fetch tiles nothing had checked. So the download this gate exists to skip
    // happened anyway — measured at the demo's own default position as three
    // tiles, with six of seven neighbours admitted (`geo-event-reach.test.ts`).
    //
    // Asking about the reach costs one set lookup per candidate and is the
    // question the paragraph above was always describing. The centre tile is
    // still exempt: the user is standing in it, so it is searched whatever it
    // costs — and it too can overhang, which is a separate open question.
    //
    // STEP 1 rides along, because the reach has to be derived to be asked
    // about. `gridDisk(steps + 1)` because the climb may move `steps` cells and
    // then needs its destination's own neighbourhood to decide it is a peak;
    // without the extra ring the last comparison reads `unknown` and the climb
    // reports `left` at the edge of the ensured set rather than of the map.
