/**
 * SCAN the event tile rather than climbing within it (DEC-A5).
 *
 * The reported bug is that an event never lands on the obviously best ground:
 * measured on a field with one clear peak, **0 hits in 24 searches**. Climbing
 * samples — it walks each seeded candidate ~1.5 of its 5 allowed steps before
 * sticking on the nearest bump — so it finds a peak only when a candidate lands
 * on one.
 *
 * Scanning is affordable for a reason that is the opposite of intuitive: a res-8
 * tile holds only **343 res-11 chunks** to score, FEWER than a climb with useful
 * reach needs.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE "404 OF 488" THIS USED TO CLAIM IS SINGLE-TILE ARITHMETIC, and the
 * search is not single-tile.** The reach accumulates over the centre tile AND
 * every admitted neighbour — measured at **2 401 cells, i.e. 343 x 7** — so the
 * pinned set can reach ~2 401 against a 488 cap. Pins beat the cap, so nothing
 * evicts mid-search and this is a memory spike rather than a correctness break;
 * but the comfortable-sounding 404 described one tile of seven.
 *
 * **The climb is kept, not deleted.** The 364 ms scan measurement is a LOWER
 * bound — no fixture holds a full tile — so this constant is the way back, and
 * the climb path keeps its own tests running rather than becoming a fallback
 * nobody exercises.
 *
 * ⚠️ **OFF: it runs, and it still does not find the peak. Cause NOT established.**
 *
 * What is established, by measurement:
 *
 * - the exhaustive branch really is taken — `evaluated` carries the shortlist
 *   size rather than the climb's ten seeded candidates;
 * - the reach is the whole tile — `reachCells` reads 2 401, i.e. 343 x 7 tiles;
 * - the target peak IS scored, at 80;
 * - and it still loses, 0 hits in 24, even after the draw was weighted by heat.
 *
 * **An earlier comment here blamed unscored neighbours (peak 80 + 0 against a
 * bump at 84). That diagnosis is NOT proven and a review argues it is wrong**:
 * the peak sits 17 rings inside the tile, the ensure set covers the enumerated
 * field exactly, and `cellState` answers `empty` (heat 1) rather than
 * `unknown` for any cell in a scored chunk — which would floor the peak at
 * 80 + 6 = 86 and win. Observation and that argument disagree, and **resolving
 * that contradiction is the next step**, not another fix.
 *
 * Two candidate explanations: the peak's neighbourhood may genuinely span chunks
 * the ensure set missed, or `picks[0]` may be a nearer tile's pick rather than
 * this tile's (`newGeoEventFor` sorts by distance to the user, and 5 tiles
 * produced picks).
 *
 * **THE SECOND ONE IS NOW THE FAVOURITE, on geometry rather than on a run**
 * (2026-08-11). In the graded fixture the peak is **395 m** from the user and in
 * the user's OWN res-8 tile, while the user stands **~30 m from that tile's
 * western edge** with the fixture's background covering ~350 m beyond it. A
 * neighbour tile therefore yields a pick nearer than 395 m on essentially every
 * roll, so the peak's tile's pick is never the one the test asserts on — and
 * "0 of 24" would read 0 for a perfect search. **Print every pick with its tile
 * before changing anything here**; the same instrument produced the climb path's
 * 0 of 24, so both figures are in doubt together.
 *
 * Left wired and inert rather than reverted: the path, the weighted draw and the
 * enumeration are all correct as far as they go, and a review confirmed the
 * enumeration is exactly complete. Only the outcome is missing.

   *    mid-climb would drop the very ground being walked.
