/**
 * Does stage 5 — derive — grow without bound as the user walks? (AR §2.8)
 *
 * WHY THIS TEST EXISTS. The AR plan predicts that `scoresByCell` and therefore
 * `deriveMs` grow across a long session, and milestone 4 declined to measure it
 * on the grounds that a phone was unavailable. That was wrong, and the r510
 * review said so: the derive path is pure JS over data a stub source can
 * produce, `deriveMs` is already a snapshot field, and `pipeline-timings.test.ts`
 * already drives a `DemoPipeline` headlessly. **It needs a loop, not a walk.**
 * This is that loop, and it is the one M4 figure the environment could always
 * have produced.
 *
 * ## The answer
 *
 * **Derive is bounded, and the bound is the chunk cap, not the distance walked.**
 * `DEFAULT_MAX_CHUNKS` is 488 retained res-11 chunks and a chunk holds 49 res-13
 * children, so `scoresByCell` cannot exceed 23 912 entries however far anyone
 * walks. Measured at the production cap, 2026-08-13, on `f936c64e` (i7-1185G7),
 * walking 3 km north from Cologne in 100 m steps and running all three
 * progressive rings at each stop — the sum over the three rings, which is what
 * one user-visible move costs:
 *
 * | m walked | cells | deriveMs | evicted |
 * | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
 * | 0 | 2 989 | 79 | 0 |
 * | 500 | 8 379 | 161 | 0 |
 * | 900 | 12 495 | 242 | 0 |
 * | 1 000 | 9 408 | 238 | 0 | ← second res-7 tile merged
 * | 1 500 | 14 357 | 278 | 0 |
 * | 2 000 | 18 326 | 390 | 0 |
 * | 2 500 | 23 275 | 1 230 | 0 |
 * | 2 600 | **23 912** | 1 108 | 12 |
 * | 2 900 | **23 912** | 1 193 | 73 |
 *
 * 23 912 is exactly 488 × 49, so the plateau is the cap and nothing else. **The
 * cost of reaching it is the finding**: ~1.1 s of derive per 100 m refresh,
 * against 79 ms at the first stop — a 14× rise over a walk. Bounded is not the
 * same as cheap, and §2.8 asked only the first question.
 *
 * **It is NOT a frame hitch, and the first draft of this comment said it was.**
 * `DemoPipeline` runs inside `worker/demo-worker.ts`, so the derive pass never
 * touches the render thread. What it actually costs is three other things:
 * the AR content lags the user by at least that much on every refetch, on top of
 * fetch and mesh time; the worker is serial, so nothing else it owns — cell
 * explanations, the geo-event search, the next ring — can be answered while it
 * runs; and on a phone a busy worker still competes with the render thread for
 * cores, so off-the-main-thread is not free. The figure is also desktop Node on
 * an i7; a phone will be slower.
 *
 * The per-cell cost is not flat either: 8.8 µs per cell per ring at the start
 * against 15 µs at the cap. Derive is a little worse than linear in the retained
 * set, which is worth knowing before anyone argues that halving the cap halves
 * the cost — it would do slightly better than that.
 *
 * ## The thing nobody predicted: a tile boundary flushes the cache
 *
 * At 1 000 m the retained set FELL, from 12 495 cells to 9 408, and the only
 * thing that happened was a second res-7 tile being merged. `acceptTile`
 * invalidates every chunk overlapping the accepted tile and a res-7 bounding box
 * is ~2.4 km across, so merging a neighbour discards scored ground the user has
 * already walked over. The next crossing at 2 000 m shows it again (18 473 →
 * 18 326); at 2 500 m the freshly scored ring more than replaced what was
 * dropped, so the net moved the other way — **the invalidation is what is
 * measured here, not its cost.** Its cost is a re-score, which lands in `scoreMs`,
 * which this fixture cannot measure (see below).
 *
 * It matters for AR because a walker at a 100 m gate crosses a res-7 boundary
 * every kilometre or two. Whether the invalidation could be narrower is an open
 * question this measurement raises and does not answer.
 *
 * ## What this run does NOT license
 *
 * **`mergeMs` and `scoreMs` are not measured here, and the table above omits
 * them deliberately.** Both scale with the FEATURES held, and the synthetic tile
 * below carries ~60 of them against a real res-7 tile's ~21 MB. Measured
 * `mergeMs` stayed at 0–4 ms across the walk, which would read as a refutation
 * of the quadratic merge growth `demo-pipeline.ts` predicts — it is nothing of
 * the kind, only a fixture too small to exercise it. That measurement is still
 * open.
 *
 * **`deriveMs` IS representative**, and that asymmetry is the whole argument for
 * the synthetic field. Stage 5 walks CELLS, and this field's cell coverage
 * matches the corpus almost exactly: `corpus-score-distribution.test.ts` scores
 * 927 cells at Cologne and 931 at Heidelberg over one radius-2 disk whose
 * geometric maximum is 19 × 49 = 931, i.e. **real city ground is essentially
 * fully covered**. A ground-covering polygon is therefore the faithful choice
 * rather than the convenient one, and the first assertion below pins that
 * calibration so a generator that drifts away from the corpus fails here instead
 * of quietly measuring itself.
 *
 * A corpus fixture could not have been used: it covers one res-7 tile, so a 3 km
 * walk leaves the data after a few hundred metres and every number afterwards
 * describes an empty map.
 *
 * ## Why the gate runs a SMALLER cap than the table above
 *
 * Reaching 488 chunks takes 2.6 km of walking and ~15 s, which would nearly
 * double this package's unit stage. The gate therefore walks against
 * {@link GATE_MAX_CHUNKS} — the same code, the same shape, a plateau in a few
 * steps. **To reproduce the table, set `GATE_MAX_CHUNKS` to `undefined` and
 * `STEPS` to 30.**
