/**
 * One row per drawable mesh layer — what it builds, and what it counts.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `BuildingView.render` was a branch per layer: one to decide
 * whether to draw it, and one ternary per counter to zero its contribution when it
 * was off. That is two edits in two places for every new layer, and it had reached
 * complexity 21 with three layers on the board. W12 (POI), W13 (roads), W14 (area
 * slabs) and W15 (filled regions) are four more, so the branchy form was going to be
 * rewritten anyway — doing it before W13 is the cheap moment (filed as the
 * complexity follow-up, 2026-07-30).
 *
 * WHAT THE TABLE BUYS BEYOND TIDINESS. The per-layer work was always the same four
 * steps — is it on, does it have anything, build it, count it — but written out
 * longhand each time, so nothing could check that a layer had all four. A row either
 * exists or it does not, and `mesh-layers.test.ts` asserts the set of rows equals
 * `DRAWN_BY_MESH`. **A layer missing from the table draws nothing, counts nothing
 * and throws nothing** — indistinguishable from a layer whose data was empty. That
 * is the same silent-absence shape as the shader outage, so it gets a real
 * assertion rather than a comment.
 *
 * WHY THE ROWS BUILD `three` OBJECTS DIRECTLY, unlike `sky-gradient.ts` which stops
 * at pixels. That split exists where there is ARITHMETIC worth proving without a
 * GPU — a colour ramp can be upside down or non-monotonic and still look
 * deliberate. Wrapping a `Float32Array` the worker already validated in a
 * `BufferGeometry` has no such arithmetic; the parts here that can be wrong are
 * coverage, defaults, counters and the ground lift, and all four are asserted
 * without a WebGL context. three's geometry and material classes are plain JS and
 * construct fine in vitest.
