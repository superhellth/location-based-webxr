/**
 * Guardrail: the AR entry's readiness signals are actually CONNECTED in
 * `main.ts` (DEC-M1, DEC-M4).
 *
 * WHY SOURCE TEXT, and it is the same argument `ar-walk-wiring.test.ts` makes at
 * length: `main.ts` builds a Leaflet map, a `WebGLRenderer` and a worker, so the
 * unit suite cannot run it, and headless Chromium has no WebXR device, so the
 * e2e cannot reach the AR path either. A static check is what is left.
 *
 * WHY IT IS WORTH HAVING HERE IN PARTICULAR. Both decisions this file guards
 * are of the shape "a value already computed correctly somewhere is never
 * handed to the thing that needs it":
 *
 * - the entry pass settles and nothing told the veil (DEC-M1), and
 * - the terrain field is replaced and nothing re-derives the quest marks
 *   (DEC-M4) — which is the ~100 m defect the eighteenth field session
 *   reported, and which every green gate in this repo missed because each
 *   module was correct in isolation.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT DO: prove the calls RUN, or that their arguments are right.
 * `ar-mode.test.ts` owns the veil's behaviour and
 * `quest-beacon-placement.test.ts` owns the placement arithmetic. This only
 * closes the gap between "each piece works" and "the app uses them".
 *
 * @see ar-entry-dom-veil.ts.md
