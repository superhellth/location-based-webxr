/**
 * Dragging the mobile map sheet up and down.
 *
 * WHY A SHEET RATHER THAN A SPLITTER. On a phone the two-row grid gave each view
 * half the height and the 3D pane was a letterbox. DEC-10 makes the 3D view fill
 * the viewport with the map as a full-width sheet over it — and once the map is
 * a sheet, "let me make the area I care about bigger" (D8) is just dragging it,
 * with no separate resize affordance to design. It is also the pattern the
 * RecorderApp's map browser already settled on.
 *
 * WHY THE CLAMP IS THE INTERESTING PART. Dragged to either extreme one view
 * disappears — and with it the handle that would bring it back, so the app is
 * stuck until a reload. The clamp is pure and tested for that reason; the rest
 * of this file is three pointer listeners.
 *
 * @see sheet-drag.ts.md
