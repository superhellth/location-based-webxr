/**
 * The automatic elevation offset: AR-measured floor vs the DEM, composed
 * with the fused vertical baseline, published for the manual nudge's channel.
 *
 * **WHAT IT MEASURES.** The framework's floor estimator reads the occupancy
 * grid in the raw AR frame; each floor hit is paired with the DEM height at
 * the hit's OWN horizontal position (slope-correct sampling — on a hillside
 * "the floor height" is position-dependent), and the baseline-free delta
 * `hitYar − (DEM + N)` streams into the framework's elevation-offset
 * estimator. The published value re-adds the live baseline:
 *
 * ```
 * autoM = baselineY + robust(hitYar − terrain)   // baselineY = matrix[13]
 * ```
 *
 * **THE SIGN** is owned by the dedicated sign test in
 * `ar-elevation-auto.test.ts` (this feature's `fieldMatchesArDatum`): a
 * measured floor ABOVE the DEM surface yields a positive offset and the city
 * RISES to meet it.
 *
 * **THE BASELINE IS RE-ADDED AT READ TIME, NEVER SMOOTHED** (plan §2.3): a
 * baseline jump — one new GPS fix re-owning the vertical solve — moves the
 * camera instantly, and the content must move WITH it or the city visibly
 * teleports and then heals over half a window. Only the slow, physical
 * floor-vs-DEM disagreement goes through the estimator.
 *
 * **TWO SMOOTHING STAGES, WITH DISJOINT JOBS** (cold-review F4 revised the
 * earlier one-stage rule). The estimator's slew limiter (0.5 m/s on the
 * baseline-free component) shapes the SIGNAL between ticks — but it cannot
 * touch the cold-start FIRST value or the re-added baseline, both of which
 * reach this module's output as steps. `ar-mode.ts` therefore eases the
 * APPLIED value toward the composed target at a bounded rate
 * (`AUTO_APPLY_RATE_M_PER_S`), so no published step ever moves the content
 * in one frame; the manual trim stays instant (owner-driven, DEC-E1).
 *
 * **PUBLISHING IS NOT APPLYING** (cold-review F1). The framework estimators
 * REPORT and the caller GATES — both their sidecars say so, and both spell the
 * gate `confidence >= 0.5`. `ArElevationAutoState.engaged` is that gate, with
 * hysteresis; see {@link AUTO_ENGAGE_CONFIDENCE}. While it is false the auto
 * contribution is ZERO and the manual trim behaves exactly as it did before
 * this feature existed, while `autoM` stays published so the HUD can show the
 * measurement AND say that it is not applied.
 *
 * **NO EXTRA GEOID TERM.** In AR the demo's terrain field is sampled with
 * `absoluteDatum = −N` (see `absoluteDatumFor`), so `heightAt` already
 * returns ELLIPSOIDAL DEM+N — the same datum the scene's y = 0 and the
 * baseline live in. The injected sampler is expected to be gated on exactly
 * that (`terrainReadout` / `fieldMatchesArDatum`) and to answer `undefined`
 * otherwise; an ungated relief-datum sample would be wrong by the whole
 * ellipsoidal height.
 *
 * **VERTICAL FRAME-INVARIANCE ASSUMPTION**: `hitYar` is used directly as the
 * baseline-free vertical, which holds iff the alignment rotation is yaw-only
 * and unscaled — true under `DefaultAlignmentConfig` and pinned by the
 * framework's own M1 tests (invariance property + config-default assertion).
 *
