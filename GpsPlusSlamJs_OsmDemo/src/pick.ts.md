# `src/pick.ts`

## Purpose

Decides what a click in the 3D view selected (W12). The raycast stays in
`BuildingView`; the judgement lives here so it can be tested without a
`WebGLRenderer`.

## Public API

- `PickCandidate` — `{ distance, faceIndex?, instanceId?, point?, userData }`.
  Deliberately not `THREE.Intersection`: these fields are the whole of what the
  decision reads, and a test must be able to construct one without a renderer.
- `ScenePoint` — `{ x, y, z }` in the scene's own frame (`x` east, `y` up, `z`
  **south**). Declared here because this is where it was first needed;
  `route-path.ts` imports the type rather than declaring a second one.
- `Pick` — `{ kind: "cell", cell }`, `{ kind: "poi", marker }`,
  `{ kind: "region", region }` or `{ kind: "ground", point }`.
- `resolvePick(hits, cellForTriangle) → Pick | undefined` — the nearest hit that
  resolves to something selectable, or the coarsest claim behind it. Never
  throws.

## The precedence chain (DEC-R7b-3a, DEC-R11-17, DEC-R11-21)

Distance is the tie-break **between peers only**:

- **cell / POI** — peers, decided by distance. Precise claims the user aimed at.
- **ground** — remembered, returned if nothing sharper turned up. **Ordering the
  agent.**
- **region** — remembered, returned only when there was no ground hit at all.
- **a solid object (building or barrier) STOPS the scan** — see below.

**The ground outranks the region, and that is DEC-R11-21 reversing what stage 4
first shipped.** Finest-claim-wins puts a region above the ground, which is what
the rest of this chain follows — and against the running demo it made the
feature unusable: the affordance slabs blanket everything near the user at the
demo's opening view, so every click resolved to a region and the agent could
never be ordered anywhere. A region is a flood fill hundreds of metres across,
where "I clicked in the big translucent area" much more often means "go there".

Region selection survives in the 2D map (unchanged) and in 3D wherever the
ground is not **drawn** — `building-view.ts` keeps a hidden ground plane out of
the raycast set, which is also what stops that branch being unreachable code.

## Invariants & assumptions

- **Buildings are still not selectable — but they are now RAYCAST** (DEC-R11-17).
  They joined the set as **blockers**: `resolvePick` stops at the first one and
  never returns it, so a click on a facade resolves to nothing rather than to the
  ground behind it. That is the original invariant's intent stated positively
  instead of by omission, and it has a second reason now — a building interior is
  unreachable since stage 3, so routing there costs the full expansion cap to
  answer "no route".
  - Because the scan is nearest-first, the blocker only reaches things BEHIND it:
    a POI pin against a facade and a region slab in front of a building both
    still resolve.
  - The cost is real and stated: the largest geometry in the scene is now in the
    picking set. W20's chunking bounds it — three tests bounding boxes before
    triangles.
- **The ground is never a peer.** It is under everything, so a nearest-hit rule
  would have let it swallow every existing click the moment it joined the set —
  the same reason region slabs are not peers, and the same grazing-angle
  failure. It is remembered and answered last among the things a cell or a
  marker can outrank.
  - **A hidden ground plane must not be in the raycast set** — three's
    `intersectObject` tests layers and nothing else, so an invisible mesh is
    still hit. `building-view.ts` guards on `visible`, which both stops the
    `none` ground mode ordering the agent onto a surface nobody can see and
    keeps the region fallback reachable.
- **A ground pick carries SCENE coordinates, not `LatLng`.** This module must
  stay constructible without an ENU frame; the frame lives on the page next to
  the scene anchor and is re-taken on a teleport, so a second copy here would go
  stale exactly when the user moves. `main.ts` converts.
  - A ground hit with no `point` is skipped rather than defaulted — a destination
    at the origin would be a confidently wrong place, which this module refuses
    everywhere else too.
- **An unidentifiable hit is SKIPPED, not fatal** — the click keeps looking
  behind it. That still holds, and is now defence in depth rather than the
  mechanism: solid objects identify themselves.
- **An unidentifiable hit is SKIPPED, not fatal** — the click keeps looking
  behind it. Selecting nothing because an unselectable object was in front reads
  as a dead control, a defect this demo already shipped once via a
  non-interactive Leaflet tooltip.
- **Nearest wins, and distance is the only tie-break.** A marker stands on the
  grid, so clicking a marker hits both. Preferring one _kind_ by rule would make
  the grid unclickable wherever a marker overlaps it, or markers unclickable
  altogether.
- **Hits are sorted here rather than trusting the caller.** three's
  `intersectObjects` does return them in distance order, but relying on that
  makes this module's contract depend on a detail of its caller's caller.
- **A grid hit whose triangle maps to no cell is ignored.** `cellForTriangle` is
  built in the same pass as the geometry, so a miss means the two have drifted —
  and a drifted lookup opens the panel on a confidently wrong cell, worse than
  opening nothing. The H3 ragged-boundary fix landed for this exact class.
- **POI markers are INSTANCED (W7), so their identity is an index too.** One
  `InstancedMesh` carries every marker and the hit's `instanceId` selects one out
  of `userData.poiInstances`. Structurally identical to the grid's
  `faceIndex → cellForTriangle`, including the failure: a lookup miss means the
  table and the matrices have drifted, and answering from a drifted table opens
  the details panel on a confidently wrong place. The table is built in the same
  loop as the instance matrices, in `mesh-layers.ts`, so it cannot.
  - A hit with no `instanceId` is skipped rather than defaulting to instance 0 —
    every hit on a non-instanced object (the cell grid shares the raycast set)
    has none, and "the first marker" would be a confident wrong answer.
- **`faceIndex` is `number | null | undefined`.** `null` is three's own type when
  the hit object is unindexed; the explicit `| undefined` alongside the `?` is
  needed because `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` is on.
- **The POI pick carries the MARKER, not an id to look up.** A lookup would be
  resolved against whatever working set is current when the panel opens, which is
  not necessarily the one the user clicked.

## Examples

```ts
const picked = resolvePick(
  raycaster.intersectObjects(targets, false).map((hit) => ({
    distance: hit.distance,
    faceIndex: hit.faceIndex,
    userData: hit.object.userData,
  })),
  cellForTriangle,
);
```

## Tests

`pick.test.ts`: cell under a grid hit; marker under a POI hit; nearest wins in
both directions; unsorted input; empty input; an unidentifiable hit is skipped
and the search continues; a triangle that maps to no cell; a `null` `faceIndex`;
the instanced-marker lookup; the region precedence.

The ground block (DEC-R11-17, DEC-R11-21) pins the chain from both ends: a cell
wins at any distance; **the ground beats a region at any distance**, in both
orders, with the test naming why the obvious rule is backwards here; a region is
still selected when there is no ground hit at all; a building in FRONT refuses
the destination; a building BEHIND does not; a marker or a region in front of a
building still resolves; and a ground hit without a point is skipped.

`playwright-tests/` › "a building stays unpickable, which W12 must not have
undone" is the end-to-end half of the invariant, and `scene-3d.spec.js` ›
"orders the agent…" is the end-to-end half of the ground case.
