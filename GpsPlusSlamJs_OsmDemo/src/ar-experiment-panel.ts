/**
 * The AR experimental-compass panel (DEC-Y10, Q2 step 5).
 *
 * Five controls for mechanisms the library ships OFF or at other values, two of
 * them documented there as not field-validated. They exist so the trade is
 * measured on a street rather than argued in a document.
 *
 * **BEHIND A GEAR, CLOSED BY DEFAULT — forced by arithmetic, not taste.** On a
 * 390 px phone the elevation control alone measures ~149 px and the compass
 * slider exceeds its own `max-width` before anything is added; five
 * always-visible controls against a camera feed is a layout that does not exist.
 *
 * **AND IT CLOSES ITSELF ON A CHANGE.** A control here is changed in order to
 * look at the buildings, so a panel still covering them defeats the purpose —
 * which is precisely what G9 reported about the compass slider being in the
 * middle of the view.
 *
 * @see ar-experiment-panel.ts.md

 * the demo never sets that, so at this arm the hysteresis DEAD BAND is
 * inverted: every sample within 25° agrees (so trust is never lost — the corpus
 * measured compass-vs-GPS offsets of −4.3…+18.8°, all inside 25°), and every
 * sample that does disagree is by definition also outside 20° (so trust drops
 * at once). The `ramp` gate's HOLD branch, which exists to ride that band, is
 * unreachable there.
 *
 * The arm is KEPT rather than replaced, because the 2026-08-20 census swept
 * exactly these three values and 25 is the one with the 74-of-81 baseline —
 * substituting 19 would buy a working dead band at the cost of a number nothing
 * has ever measured. What was actually wrong is that the panel offered the
 * degenerate arm without saying so, which is the part this label fixes.
