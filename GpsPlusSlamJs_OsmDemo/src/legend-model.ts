/**
 * What the colours mean, as data.
 *
 * WHY A LEGEND REPLACES THE SENTENCE RATHER THAN JOINING IT. The header used to
 * carry `describeScale`'s "above 1 (the identity is 1) up to 8, log scale — each
 * colour step is an equal RATIO, because the score is a product". First-session
 * feedback was that it is not readable. It is also not decoration: it is the
 * on-screen answer to iteration 8's second question — are the unbounded scores
 * practically thresholdable — and deleting it deletes an answer. So the claim is
 * kept and the FORM changes (DEC-13): a swatch strip says the same thing
 * pictorially, and the sentence survives as the strip's accessible text.
 *
 * WHY THE CATEGORY NAME IS PART OF IT. The reported symptom was "switching
 * category did not reset the map". The map does redraw — but every category
 * scores nearly every rule, so the same hexagons come back in similar colours
 * whatever category is selected. A picture that does not say what it is a
 * picture OF cannot be checked by eye, and naming the category is the smallest
 * thing that makes the redraw visible.
 *
 * **This reason used to be stated as "`heatScale` re-normalises the ramp to
 * each category's own maximum", and that mechanism was deleted by DEC-H5.** The
 * reason survives the mechanism — what makes the picture ambiguous is the
 * OVERLAP between categories, not the normalisation, and a fixed ramp does
 * nothing about overlap. Corrected rather than dropped because it is the
 * rationale for a test, and a rationale citing a function that no longer exists
 * reads as though the test is obsolete.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A PURE MODEL AND NOT A DOM BUILDER. The interesting parts — which
 * bands exist, what they are labelled, that no two of them render alike — are
 * decisions, and decisions deserve tests that do not need a browser.
 *
