/**
 * The geo-event button's terminal label (F56).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. An event tile is ~900 m across and the demo opens at zoom
 * 18, showing a couple of hundred metres — so pressing the button very often
 * draws the winner outside the viewport and the map looks unchanged. The label
 * is what makes that legible: "Event at 14:15 · 640 m NE" says the feature
 * worked and where to look, without moving the camera.
 *
 * MOVING THE CAMERA WAS THE ALTERNATIVE AND WAS DECLINED (F56, owner decision
 * 2026-08-04) — **AND THAT WAS REVERSED ON 2026-08-19 (DEC-U12).** The map now
 * pans to the winner at the current zoom when the button is pressed. The
 * objection F56 recorded was to an UNINVITED viewport takeover, and a move
 * triggered by an explicit press is not uninvited; holding the zoom is what
 * keeps it a pan rather than a takeover.
 *
 * So the paragraph above is why this module used to carry the whole
 * description, and it no longer does: the button is one of two constants
 * (F4a), the description goes to the toast, and what survives here is
 * {@link geoEventReadout} — the distance and bearing that re-read as the user
 * walks, which was F56's actual win and is the one thing neither the pan nor
 * the toast replaces.
 *
 * Pure and separately testable, because the arithmetic — a bearing across the
 * antimeridian, a distance that should read "1.2 km" not "1204 m" — has more
 * edge cases than the button that shows it.
 *
 * @see event-label.ts.md
