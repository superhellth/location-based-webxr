/**
 * The geo-event button's terminal label (F56).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. An event tile is ~900 m across and the demo opens at zoom
 * 18, showing a couple of hundred metres — so pressing the button very often
 * draws the winner outside the viewport and the map looks unchanged. The label
 * is what makes that legible: "Event at 14:15 · 640 m NE" says the feature
 * worked and where to look, without moving the camera.
 *
 * MOVING THE CAMERA WAS THE ALTERNATIVE AND WAS DECLINED (F56, owner decision
 * 2026-08-04). This demo does not take over the viewport uninvited; a HUD in
 * the 3D view is scoped as its own round.
 *
 * Pure and separately testable, because the arithmetic — a bearing across the
 * antimeridian, a distance that should read "1.2 km" not "1204 m" — has more
 * edge cases than the button that shows it.
 *
 * @see event-label.ts.md

 *
 * THE VALUE SHOWN IS THE RESOLVED SLOT, NOT THE REQUESTED INSTANT, and that is
 * not a detail: `nextEventTime` quantises to the next quarter-hour, so a request
 * for 18:07 legitimately produces an 18:15 event. Showing what was asked for
