/**
 * What a geo-event search actually cost (DEC-G7, W7).
 *
 * WHY MEASURE BEFORE OPTIMISING, stated as the decision rather than as a slogan.
 * The session offered three explanations for "5–10 s on the phone with the data
 * already cached" — no early stop, climbs wandering too far, no parallelism —
 * and they predict DIFFERENT profiles, so one measurement picks the lever and
 * two of the three cost nothing to reject. One of them is already disproved on
 * the code alone: `newGeoEventFor` produces exactly one pick per tile and
 * `bestPickForTile` returns at the first passing batch, so there is no
 * post-sixth probing to remove.
 *
 * THE PREDICTION THIS EXISTS TO TEST, stated up front so a null result is still
 * a result. `affordance-index.ts` sizes one candidate batch at ~190 chunks and
 * concludes that against its 488-chunk cap "that cannot happen" — but a
 * geo-event pins the union over up to SEVEN tiles, on the order of ~1300. So
 * `pinnedOverCap` should be non-zero, and a zero is the interesting outcome,
 * because it would mean the reach is far smaller than the arithmetic says and
 * the cost is somewhere else entirely.
 *
 * WHY LOOKUPS RATHER THAN CLIMB COUNT ALONE. A climb that starts on unscored
 * ground returns after ONE lookup; a climb with somewhere to go does five steps
 * of seven-neighbour reads. So "how many climbs" and "how much work" are
 * different numbers by two orders of magnitude, and only the second one
 * explains a wall-clock figure.
 *
 * @see geo-event-stats.ts.md
