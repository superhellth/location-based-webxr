/**
 * WHY THESE TESTS MATTER (round three, G5, DEC-W1).
 *
 * This is the one surface in the demo with an obligation attached rather than a
 * preference. ODbL requires the OpenStreetMap credit to be reasonably visible
 * wherever the data is shown, and this repo has recorded — in `map-view.ts` and
 * `main.ts` — that the elevation credits are required "the same as the OSM
 * one", which is precisely why they were put in the always-visible attribution
 * bar rather than in the collapsible header.
 *
 * The thirteenth session asked for that bar to become one thin line with "one
 * word per attribution" and an expander. The first plan for it put the
 * elevation credits behind the tap and argued that only ODbL was in play; that
 * was false, and the cold review caught it. What ships instead keeps a SHORT
 * NAME for every source permanently visible and moves only the long text behind
 * the expander — which satisfies the owner's request more literally, not less.
 *
 * So the assertion that carries the weight is the first one: every source is
 * named without anyone interacting. A test that only checked the expanded state
 * would pass on a control that hides a credit until tapped.
