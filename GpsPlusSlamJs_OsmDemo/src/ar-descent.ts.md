# `ar-descent.ts`

## Purpose

The AR entry fly-down (H5, round four Q5): the session starts at the height the
user was already looking from in the 3D view, holds, then eases to ground while
the camera feed fades in.

**"Fly-down" names what the CAMERA does, and that is the whole trap.** What the
user sees is the city **rising from below** to meet them — the two descriptions
are the same motion in different frames of reference, and reading the milestone's
name as a description of the content is precisely how r541 shipped the city
falling out of the sky. Anything in this module that carries a direction is
written from the **content's** frame: the offset is negative and increases.

## Public API

- `descentOffsetM({ elapsedS, startM }): number` — the move's contribution to the
  elevation composition, metres. **The return is NEGATIVE or zero**, and its
  magnitude shrinks to 0: the city starts below the user and rises to meet them.
  `startM` is still a POSITIVE height (the height the 3D view was looking from);
  the frame conversion happens inside, once.
  - **Why negative (DEC-Y14).** The intent is that the CAMERA starts high, but
    the XR camera is the device pose and cannot be moved, so the world is moved
    instead — and a camera at `+H` above the world is the world at `−H` below the
    camera. `applyElevation` writes `up: geometricOffset.up + offsetM`, so a
    positive term would raise the city over the user's head. r541 shipped exactly
    that and it was reported from the field as inverted.
- `descentComplete({ elapsedS, startM }): boolean` — the end-state signal.
- `DESCENT_HOLD_S = 2`, `DESCENT_FALL_S = 10`, `DESCENT_MAX_START_M = 100` — a
  **12 s** animation in total.

### Why 12 s and not the 6 s that shipped (DEC-L2, 2026-08-23)

The seventeenth field session watched the 6 s entry on a phone and asked for
double. The extra six seconds went **entirely into the fall**: a longer
motionless hold is the ambiguity the waiting line exists to cover, so doubling
it too would have bought the worst kind of time.

The argument that decided it is not aesthetic. The auto-elevation correction
glides in at `AUTO_APPLY_RATE_M_PER_S` (1.5 m/s), so a 10 m residual takes
~6.7 s **from the moment the estimator engages** — against a 6 s animation that
correction landed after the veil was gone and showed as late movement.

⚠️ **This makes the correction more likely to be hidden; it does not guarantee
it.** Engagement time while standing still has never been measured, which is the
open question in
`GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-08-21-1120-ar-entry-gate-fallback-may-be-the-normal-path-followup.md`.

**One clock still carries both halves of the effect**: `entryVeilAlpha` is a
function of the same `elapsedS`, so the sphere and the fly-in cannot drift
apart. **It no longer tracks this animation's PROGRESS, though** (DEC-M3): it
holds at fully opaque until `DESCENT_HOLD_S + DESCENT_FALL_S` and fades only
afterwards, because the eighteenth session's point was that passthrough behind a
city that has not arrived is two pictures rather than an overlay. Lengthening
the fall therefore lengthens the opaque period rather than stretching a fade.

## Invariants & assumptions

- **The descent is a THIRD TERM in `composeElevationM`, never its own write.**
  `applyElevation` SETS rather than accumulates, and the frame loop re-applies
  the composition whenever the eased auto value moves — so a descent written the
  obvious way is **clobbered** within a frame or two rather than merely
  contended with.
- **It lands at exactly 0**, not approximately: this term is added to the applied
  elevation for the rest of the session, so a residual millimetre is a permanent
  offset on the whole city.
- **Zero slope at both ends** (`smoothstep`, shared from [`easing.ts`](./easing.ts.md)
  since 2026-08-24). A linear ramp starts and stops
  abruptly, which at arm's length looks like the scene was dropped.
- **`DESCENT_MAX_START_M` is at or below `NUDGE_LIMIT_M`, and that is a real
  constraint** — it was 120 against a nudge reach of 100 until a test caught it.
  If the move may begin further than the manual nudge can reach, an
  **interrupted** entry leaves the user unable to walk the scene back **up** by
  hand — the city is left low, not high (DEC-Y14 inverted the frame; the
  constraint survives because `NUDGE_LIMIT_M` is symmetric ±100). That is the
  unrecoverable state the nudge's limit exists to prevent, arriving by a route
  that limit was not written for. Asserted in `elevation-nudge.test.ts`.
- **An automatic move gets the tighter bound**, deliberately: the user did not
  ask for this height and has not been given a reason to expect it.
- **Every non-finite or negative input collapses to 0** — "no descent" — rather
  than propagating. This value is added to the position the city is drawn at, and
  a `NaN` there raises no error anywhere; the failure reads as "AR is empty",
  indistinguishable from several other causes.
- **A zero start is no descent at all**, not a zero-length animation: AR entered
  from a ground-level 3D view behaves exactly as it did before this feature,
  camera visible at once.

## The clock, and the trap in it

`ar-mode` starts the descent on the **first frame**, not at `startArMode`.
`elapsed` is PAGE-relative — a session entered thirty seconds after load sees its
first frame at `elapsed ≈ 30` — so anchoring to 0 would make the hold and the
fall both already over before a single frame ran, and the feature would silently
do nothing on any page that had been open a while.

## The camera fade

Driven by the same clock as the descent, so the two cannot drift apart: a camera
that finished fading before the city landed would show the real world with a city
still floating above it, which is the datum-bug picture.

**Rendered by a backdrop mesh — [`ar-entry-veil.ts`](./ar-entry-veil.ts.md) —
and NOT by `renderer.setClearAlpha` (DEC-J1, overturning DEC-Y3).**

DEC-Y3 chose the clear alpha, reasoning that AR entry sets
`scene.background = null`, that the clear then uses the renderer's own
`clearColor`/`clearAlpha`, and that the framework's renderer is built
`alpha: true`. **All three premises are true and the conclusion is still false.**
`WebGLBackground.render()` reads `renderer.xr.getEnvironmentBlendMode()` _after_
applying that clear and overwrites it — `(0,0,0,0)` for `alpha-blend`, which is
every video-passthrough phone, and `(0,0,0,1)` for `additive`, where opaque black
_is_ transparent. So the camera was visible from the first frame, which is what
the fifteenth field session reported.

**No gate here could have caught it.** `getEnvironmentBlendMode()` returns
`'opaque'` outside an XR session, so the override never fires in vitest or in
headless Chromium, and the assertion that `setClearAlpha` had been called passed
the whole time against a call that did nothing on device. `ar-mode.test.ts` now
asserts the opposite — that it is **never** called.

⚠️ **`cameraFadeAlpha` is GONE (DEC-M6).** It survived DEC-J1 as the curve the
mesh veil derived from, and DEC-M3 removed that last caller: the sphere now has
its own curve on the same clock. The history above is kept here because it is
about `setClearAlpha`, which is what a future reader will come looking for; the
curve's own story is in `ar-entry-veil.ts`.

## Tests

`ar-descent.test.ts` — the curve: the hold, the exact landing, zero slope at both
ends, monotonicity, the cap, the all-inputs finiteness property, and the
zero-start contract.

`ar-mode.test.ts` → "the AR entry fly-down (H5, Q5)" — the wiring: that the term
reaches `attachContentTo` composed, that a ground-level view changes nothing,
that the fade is driven, and that the landing is announced exactly once.

Both blocks are **mutation-verified**: a descent that never lands fails three
wiring tests including the landing signal, and one that never SINKS fails three
others.

One note for anyone tightening `descentOffsetM`: given the smoothstep curve and
a 1/60 s step, `if (t >= 1) return 0;` is **unreachable from the frame loop** —
`1 - smoothstep(t)` underflows to exactly 0 a frame earlier, so the descent
reports complete first. The branch is still correct and still needed for a
caller that skips frames, and `ar-descent.test.ts` covers it directly. Do not
read a surviving mutation on that line as a coverage gap; see
`GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-08-20-1055-descent-wiring-test-survives-a-stall-mutation-followup.md`.

## The entry gate (r543)

`descentMayStart({ waitedS, estimateReady })` — whether the descent may begin.

**The jump it removes.** _"Das erste Mal ... starte ich bei Altitude null ...
wodurch ich dann erstmal sehr weit unter der Open Street Map Welt bin und dann
wird meine Altitude gefixt, so dass ich dann auf einmal über die OSM Welt
springe."_ The descent used to begin on the first frame, when the auto-elevation
term is still `0` because no estimate has arrived. The city was therefore placed
by an uncorrected datum, and the correction landed **mid-descent**, as a jump. A
second entry looked fine because the estimate was already warm.

- `estimateReady` means **engaged**, not merely present: an unengaged estimate
  contributes zero to the composition, so starting on one starts on the same `0`
  the jump comes from.
- `DESCENT_ESTIMATE_WAIT_S = 3` is a **fallback, not a budget**. A device with no
  depth and no DEM never engages the estimator, and an unbounded wait there is a
  black screen with no way out — worse than the jump.
- A non-finite `waitedS` collapses to **"not yet"**, never to "go": failing the
  other way places the city from the zeroed estimate this gate exists to wait
  for, i.e. straight back into the reported bug.

**How `ar-mode.ts` uses it, and why the shape is not the obvious one.** The city
is attached **eagerly** at `startArMode`, already at descent depth, and the
passthrough is held **black** until the gate opens. The first attach is _not_
deferred to the frame that opens the gate, because `attachContentTo` can throw
and `startArMode`'s `catch` is what turns that into a clean rollback — moving the
attach into the frame callback moved it out of that catch, leaving a live session
with no city and no error. A test written for exactly that path caught it.

The auto term is then **snapped**, not eased, on the frame the gate opens: the
ease exists so a live correction cannot jump under someone who is looking at it,
and nothing has been visible during the wait.

Note also that `ar-mode.ts`'s start guard no longer tests `descentM === 0`. With
the city attached at descent depth, `descentM` is already `-startM` on the first
frame, so that condition would never hold again and silently disabled the whole
descent — four tests caught it, all reporting the city stuck at its starting
depth.
