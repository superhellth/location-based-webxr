/**
 * Can the AR content still be SEEN once the environment map is gone?
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS — milestone 2's last claim, "materials verified to
 * actually draw". The desktop view lights its `MeshStandardMaterial`s from
 * `scene.environment`: `sky-rig.ts` PMREM-processes the sky and assigns it, and
 * that indirect light is a real part of what the demo looks like. **AR has
 * none** — `ar-scene-environment.ts` clears it deliberately, because the one
 * time this project assigned a raw equirect texture there, every standard
 * material failed to compile and silently stopped drawing for ten work items
 * while the suite stayed green.
 *
 * So AR keeps the materials and removes their indirect light. That is safe for
 * a diffuse material and NOT safe for a metallic one: at `metalness = 1` the
 * diffuse term is zero by definition and the whole surface is whatever the
 * environment reflects, so with no environment it is black. A metallic building
 * would draw perfectly, pass every existing assertion, and be invisible.
 *
 * These are properties of the materials rather than of AR, which is the point:
 * the constraint has to be checked where the materials are AUTHORED, since
 * nobody editing `mesh-layers.ts` for the desktop look is thinking about a mode
 * that removes their environment map.
 *
 * **What this canNOT prove is that pixels appear** — that needs a GL context and
 * ultimately a phone, and §6 of the plan says so. It proves the specific
 * property whose absence would make them not appear.
