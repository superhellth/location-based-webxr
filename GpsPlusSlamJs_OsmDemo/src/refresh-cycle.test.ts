/**
 * The refresh cycle — the only thing in the demo that can fail two ways.
 *
 * Why these tests matter:
 * The reported defect was a map still drawing the previous category's cells
 * under a status line saying the refresh had failed. Fixing it is not just
 * "clear on error": the old `try` wrapped the data step AND both view renders,
 * so a three.js exception and an Overpass 429 arrived at the same `catch` and
 * would get the same treatment. Blanking a correct map because the 3D pane threw
 * is the same class of lie in the other direction. These tests pin the split at
 * the seam where it can actually be known — the data step reports `fetchFailed`,
 * a view reports `nonFatalError`, and only the first clears the picture.
 *
