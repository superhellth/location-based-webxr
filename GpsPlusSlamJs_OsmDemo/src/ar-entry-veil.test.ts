/**
 * Tests for the AR entry veil (J1, DEC-J1..DEC-J4).
 *
 * **Why these tests matter, and why they are not the same tests the entry
 * ground had.** This module puts a screen-filling, initially OPAQUE surface
 * between the camera feed and the city. Two failures matter and they pull in
 * opposite directions:
 *
 * - **A veil that outlives the entry is a lid over the passthrough** — the worst
 *   outcome available here. Every degenerate input therefore resolves to "no
 *   veil", never to an opaque one.
 * - **A veil that never appears is the defect this module exists to fix.**
 *   `renderer.setClearAlpha` was the previous mechanism and is provably dead
 *   inside an `immersive-ar` session: three's `WebGLBackground.render()` reads
 *   `xr.getEnvironmentBlendMode()` AFTER applying our clear and overwrites it to
 *   `(0,0,0,0)` for `alpha-blend`, i.e. every phone.
 *
 * **NONE of this proves the veil is visible on a device**, because no gate here
 * opens an XR session. What these tests pin is everything that CAN be pinned
 * without one: the curve, the material contract, and the disposal paths.
