/**
 * The vertical offset ladder for everything drawn at ground level.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ONE MODULE AND NOT A CONSTANT PER FILE. Five things now want to be at
 * y ≈ 0: the terrain plane, ground plates, road ribbons, merged-area slabs and the
 * affordance grid. Coplanar geometry z-fights — a shimmering stripe wherever two
 * surfaces meet, which changes with the camera and reads as a rendering bug rather
 * than as a layering decision. The fix is that no two of them are ever coplanar, and
 * that is only checkable if the offsets are stated together.
 *
 * It existed implicitly before as `cell-mesh.ts`'s lone `GRID_LIFT_M`. That was fine
 * with one lifted layer and stops being fine at five: each new constant would be
 * chosen against whichever neighbour its author happened to think of.
 *
 * THE ORDER IS A DESIGN DECISION, not an accident of magnitude:
 *
 *  - **plates** sit lowest, just above the terrain. They are the ground's own
 *    surface — a car park IS the ground there.
 *  - **roads** sit above plates, because a road crossing a landuse polygon should
 *    read as being on top of it, which is also true.
 *  - **areas** (merged affordance regions) sit above both, because they are a claim
 *    ABOUT the ground rather than a part of it.
 *  - **cells** sit highest, because the per-cell grid is the finest-grained claim and
 *    is the thing being inspected — it must never be occluded by a coarser one.
 *
 * WHY THE STEPS ARE SO SMALL. Large enough to beat depth-buffer precision at the
 * camera's near/far range (0.5 m to 4000 m), small enough that nothing looks like it
 * is floating. 4 cm between layers is invisible at any distance this scene is viewed
 * from and is ~three orders of magnitude above the depth resolution there.
 *

 * Draw order for the TRANSPARENT layers (DEC-R7b-7).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. Until round 8 nothing in the demo set `renderOrder`,
 * so every translucent surface was ordered by three's default — back-to-front by
 * distance from the camera. That is the right rule for unrelated transparent
 * objects and the wrong one for two surfaces making the SAME claim at different
 * grains: whether a region slab composites over or under the cells inside it
 * would flip as the camera moved, which reads as flicker rather than as a
 * decision.
 *
 * THE ORDER IS THE LADDER'S ORDER, coarse to fine, so the finer claim always
 * wins. It mirrors `groundLift` deliberately — a reader who changes one and not
 * the other should find them obviously adjacent.
 *
 * Only the layers that are actually translucent appear here. An opaque mesh does
 * not need an order, and giving it one would opt it out of the depth-sorted
 * batch it belongs in.
 *
 * THAT IS A REQUIREMENT ON THE MATERIAL, not a description of one. `WebGLRenderer`
 * splits its render list into opaque / transmissive / transparent and draws
 * opaque first; `renderOrder` only sorts WITHIN a list. So an opaque material
 * with a high rung still draws before every translucent layer and gets blended
 * over — it ranks above them in this table and loses to them on screen. Review
 * on #256 found exactly that: the underground lines shipped opaque.
