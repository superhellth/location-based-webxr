/**
 * The route cost's score penalty (DEC-R13-1, DEC-R13-11, DEC-R13-12,

 *
 * Why these tests matter:
 * This is the only place in the round where a number decides a behaviour the
 * user will describe in words ("he follows the paths", "he goes straight"). The
 * four things worth pinning are the four the decisions argued about, and each
 * has a way of going quietly wrong:
 *
 * - **the floor** — a penalty below 1 makes the A\* heuristic inadmissible and
 *   the routes stop being optimal, silently;
 * - **the neutral value** — an unscored cell must not be the CHEAPEST cell, or
 *   the planner gains a standing incentive to route around the scored disk
 *   rather than through it (DEC-R13-12 amending DEC-R13-2);
 * - **the direction** — a higher score must never cost more, which is the whole
 *   of what "prefer the walkable tiles" means;
 * - **the reference scale** — fixed constants, so the same click gives the same
 *   route after a pan (DEC-R13-13). A test cannot see that directly; what it can
 *   see is that nothing in the signature could carry a moving baseline.
