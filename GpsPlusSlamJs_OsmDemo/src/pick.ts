/**
 * What a click in the 3D view selects (W12).
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE. Picking used to be four lines inside
 * `BuildingView` answering one question — which cell is under the pointer. W12
 * makes it answer "which *thing*", and the moment there are two kinds of answer
 * there is a precedence question, a nearest-hit question and a
 * what-happens-over-a-building question, none of which can be tested through a
 * class that needs a `WebGLRenderer`.
 *
 * So the raycast stays in the view and the DECISION lives here — the same split
 * this repo already uses for worker and shader logic: keep the judgement in a
 * pure module that the device layer thinly wraps.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT W12 MUST NOT UNDO: buildings are not selectable. `building-view`
 * excluded them deliberately, because hitting a building should not silently
 * select the cell behind it as though the building had been chosen.
 *
 * **STAGE 4 CHANGED HOW THAT INVARIANT IS HELD, NOT WHAT IT SAYS** (DEC-R11-17).
 * Ordering an agent needs a destination, and there was nothing to click: the
 * ground was absent from the raycast set by construction and the affordance grid
 * is off by default, so a click on open ground resolved to nothing. The ground
 * now joins the set as the COARSEST claim, and buildings join it as **blockers**
 * — never a destination, and never transparent to the ground behind them. That
 * is the original intent stated positively rather than by omission, and it has a
 * second reason now: a building interior is unreachable since stage 3, so
 * routing there costs a full exhaustive search to answer "no route".

 *
 * Distance is the only tie-break BETWEEN PEERS, and that is deliberate. A marker
 * stands on the grid, so a click on a marker hits both — preferring one KIND by
 * rule would make the grid unclickable wherever a marker overlaps it, or markers
 * unclickable altogether.
 *
 * A REGION IS NOT A PEER, and it is the one exception (DEC-R7b-3a). A region is
 * a flood fill OVER cells, so its slab covers every cell inside it by
 * construction — the overlap is total rather than incidental, which is exactly
 * the case the distance rule handles badly. The finer claim wins: a region is
 * resolved only when nothing sharper was hit.
 *
 * Relying on the 4 cm the layer ladder puts between them would work from
 * overhead and fail at a grazing angle, where the slab in front of a cell is
 * nearer. That is a bug that appears only at certain camera angles, which is the
 * class this round already spent a session diagnosing.
 *
 * An unidentifiable hit is SKIPPED, not fatal: the click keeps looking behind
 * it. Selecting nothing because an unselectable object was in front reads as a
 * dead control, which is the defect this demo already had once with a
