/**
 * The Leaflet view: the res-13 affordance grid and its region outlines.
 *
 * WHY LEAFLET RATHER THAN THE AR VIEW FOR THE FIRST LOOK. §8.4 is explicit that
 * the AR overlay is a gross-failure detector, not a fine judgement instrument —
 * OSM footprints carry low-metre absolute error, plausibly more than the fusion
 * error being measured. A 2D map against the OSM raster basemap has no such
 * ambiguity: if a lawn is not scoring walkable, that is a scoring fact, not a
 * pose question.
 *
 * WHY THE DRAWING IS SEPARATE FROM THE DATA. `demo-pipeline.ts` produces cells
 * and regions with no DOM at all and is unit-tested; this file only turns them
 * into layers. When the map looks wrong, that split is what makes it possible to
 * ask "is the data wrong or the drawing wrong?" and get an answer.
