/**
 * Turning a date box and a time box into an instant, and back (DEC-G1, W6).
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE. `<input type="date">` and `<input type="time">`
 * both hand back strings in a fixed format and neither knows about the other,
 * so "what instant did the user pick" is arithmetic — and it is the arithmetic
 * that is easy to get wrong in a way nobody notices until they are in another
 * timezone. Doing it inside the dialog would make it reachable only through a
 * DOM.
 *
 * **LOCAL TIME, EXPLICITLY (DEC-G1).** The demo already used the device's zone
 * implicitly, by passing `Date.now()`; making the picker explicit does not
 * change which zone is meant, it just says so. `new Date(y, m, d, hh, mm)` is
 * the local-time constructor, which is the whole point — `Date.parse` on an
 * ISO-like string without an offset is the trap, since `"2026-08-07T18:00"` is
 * local but `"2026-08-07"` alone is UTC, in the same engine, by spec.
 *
 * **The accepted cost, restated because it is a real one:** two devices in
 * different zones asking for "18:00" get different absolute instants, and
 * therefore different events. Cross-tab determinism is unaffected, since two
 * tabs share a zone.
 *
 * @see event-instant.ts.md
