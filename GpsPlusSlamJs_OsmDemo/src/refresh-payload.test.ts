/**
 * WHY THIS TEST EXISTS (round 10 §2, §7).
 *
 * The round-10 plan claims three things about what a refresh costs, and all
 * three were read off the code rather than observed. This file MEASURES them,
 * so the plan's numbers are evidence instead of argument — and so the stages
 * that follow have a before/after figure rather than a feeling.
 *
 * The measurements are written as assertions with generous bounds, not as
 * `console.log`. A logged number is read once and then rots; an assertion fails
 * when the thing it describes changes, which is the only way a performance
 * claim stays true.
