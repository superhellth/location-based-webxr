/**
 * Tests for the map-zoom → 3D-camera-distance conversion (H2, Q6).
 *
 * Why these tests matter: the map's +/- buttons now drive the 3D view, and the
 * conversion is the only part with arithmetic in it. Two properties carry the
 * whole feature — that the two views agree about how much ground is on screen,
 * and that the clamp holds. The clamp is not decoration: Leaflet has no
 * `minZoom` here, so zooming fully out asks for a ~36 km camera, which is past
 * the 2400 m far plane and renders an empty grey screen.
