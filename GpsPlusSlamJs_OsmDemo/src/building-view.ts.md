# `src/building-view.ts`

## Purpose

The three.js view: buildings and trees built from the same merged features the
map scored.

## Public API

- `class BuildingView` — `render(mesh: TransferableMesh, layers?: MeshLayers): BuildingStats`
  (the geometry is built in the WORKER now; this file only turns typed arrays
  into three.js objects, which is what its header always claimed it was for),
  `renderCells(mesh)`, `setTerrain(field | undefined)`,
  `setGroundDebug(enabled)`, `clearScene()`, `resize()`, `dispose()`,
  `followRoute(path)`, `clearRoute()`, `agentAt()`, `cameraView()`,
  `lookAtFrom(target, distanceM)`,
  `attachContentTo(root, frame)`, `localRoot`.
  - **`attachContentTo` / `localRoot` are the AR seam** (plan milestone 0). The
    map-derived content — the layer group, the cell mesh and its outlines —
    lives on a `SceneContent` root that can be handed to the framework's scene
    graph and taken back. **The `frame` argument is not cosmetic:** this view's
    scene is X=East, Y=Up, Z=−North and the GPS-world frame is NUE, so
    attaching without `"gps-world-nue"` renders the city 90° off. See
    [`scene-content.ts.md`](scene-content.ts.md) for the mapping, what stays
    behind, and why picking in AR needs the raycast set resolved first.
    Navigation is `MapControls`, attached internally; there is nothing to call —
    but the view now REPORTS it through the `onCameraMove(view)` option, fired on
    every `change` and deliberately unthrottled, because sampling is a policy the
    page can see and the view cannot (DEC-R13-7, `throttle.ts`).
  - `lookAtFrom` translates then dollies, both relative, for the same reason
    `recentreOn` exists: recomputing the camera from a distance and two angles
    would place the target correctly and quietly re-derive the ORIENTATION —
    which is exactly the pose data DEC-R13-7 chose not to store.
- `TERRAIN_SPACING_M` — 12 m, the Terrarium z13 pixel pitch at this latitude.
- `MeshLayers` and `BuildingStats` — **re-exported from `mesh-layers.ts`**, which
  owns them because it owns what they describe. `BuildingStats` is `volumes`,
  `parts`, `triangles`, `guessedHeights`, `approximateRoofs`, `trees`, `plates`,
  `plateTriangles`.
  (`treeConePosition` was removed in W6: trees are instanced now, and the ENU→
  scene reflection comes from the package's `packInstances`, which is tested where
  it lives.)

## Invariants & assumptions

- **`TERRAIN_EXTENT_M` is imported from `heightfield.ts`, not owned here.** It
  moved on 2026-07-31 because the worker needs the same number (to clip ground
  plates before triangulating) and must not import three. This file uses it for
  the ground plane's size and the terrain grid; there is no re-export, so other
  consumers import it from `heightfield.js` directly.
- **Frames are scheduled ON DEMAND, never in a permanent loop.** The scene is
  static except while the camera is moving, so `requestFrame()` coalesces to one
  pending rAF and the `controls` `change` event drives it. A permanent loop was
  the first attempt and was measured to make the e2e suite ~6x slower
  (21 s -> 2.2 m) and push one test into a timeout; on a phone it is a scene
  that never stops drawing. Damping still works: `controls.update()` emits
  another `change` while the camera eases, which schedules the next frame, so
  the sequence sustains itself and then stops.
  - **The walking agent is the ONE thing that schedules a frame from inside a
    frame** (stage 4, DEC-R11-15), and it stops on its own: the callback only
    re-arms while `advanceWalk()` returns `true`. A walk that never finished
    would be the permanent loop this whole invariant exists against — which is
    why `pointAlong`'s `done` is asserted as hard as its position, and why the
    e2e's second half asserts the scene going QUIET rather than moving.
    - **SINCE ROUND 13 IT TAKES TWO CONDITIONS, NOT ONE**, and the second is the
      part a future reader most needs: `advanceWalk()` returns `false` only once
      `pointAlong` reports `done` **AND** `followerSettled` agrees. The agent is
      a damped body now (`agent-follower.ts`), so it is ~2.4 m behind when the
      path is consumed — ending on `done` alone froze it short of its
      destination, with the drawn line finishing somewhere it never reached.
    - The invariant survives because the follower **provably settles**: a
      property test pins that it reaches the end of any generated route, so
      `false` still means "nothing is moving" rather than "the path ran out".
  - **`data-frames` on the container is the observable behind that.** It is a
    monotonic counter written in the same callback, and it joins the family
    `publishFrameState` started with `data-frame-origin` and
    `data-ground-centre`: "the scene went quiet" has no machine-readable
    definition otherwise, and a screenshot comparison also passes for a scene
    that stopped drawing entirely. `data-route` and `data-agent` are the other
    two members — the second exists so "the agent did not teleport back to the
    start" is assertable.
  - **The route's material must be `transparent`.** `WebGLRenderer` draws the
    opaque list first and `renderOrder` only sorts WITHIN a list, so an opaque
    line with `RENDER_ORDER.route` ranks above the translucent layers in the
    table and loses to them on screen. That is the #256 finding on the
    underground lines, repeated here and caught in review on #274.
- **`dispose()` cancels the pending frame FIRST.** An orphaned frame callback
  touching a disposed WebGL context crashes rather than leaks.
  - This is why `clearRoute()` is split into a `removeRoute()` that does not
    repaint: `dispose()` calls the latter, because the public form requests a
    frame and would schedule one behind the cancellation's back.
- **The route and the agent live on the SCENE, not on `this.group`** — for the
  same reason the affordance grid is also kept out of the group (though the grid
  now sits on `this.content`, see below): `clear()` empties
  the group on every mesh rebuild, and a route dropped by an unrelated republish
  would read as the agent having been cancelled. The scene's frame is fixed
  (round 5B), so a publish does not invalidate their coordinates; only a
  re-anchor does, and `main.ts` calls `clearRoute()` there.
  - **The agent mesh is removed but NOT disposed by `clearRoute()`.** It is built
    once and reused for every route; freeing it there would make the second route
    draw nothing at all, which three does not report as an error. `dispose()`
    frees it.
- **The raycast set gained the ground and the buildings in stage 4**
  (DEC-R11-17). Buildings are still not selectable — `resolvePick` stops at the
  first one and never returns it — but they must be RAYCAST so a click on a
  facade does not fall through to the ground behind it. The ground carries
  `userData.ground`, and the marker and the membership are one fact rather than
  two: setting the membership without the marker is a silent no-op, which is
  exactly how the first implementation failed (the ray hit the plane, the hit
  could not be identified, and the click read as a dead control).
  - **The ground joins it only while `visible` AND on the CPU displacement
    path.** three's raycaster does not skip invisible objects, so `visible` has
    to be checked here; and only the CPU path writes the displaced POSITION
    BUFFER, which is the only geometry a ray meets. Under `gpu` the ray would
    hit a FLAT plane while the user looks at a shader-displaced one, and since
    the destination is read as `x`/`z` the error is horizontal — roughly
    `relief / tan(elevation)` on an oblique click. See `groundIsOrderable`.
  - **Picking blocks on the DRAWN volume; navigation blocks on the SOLID one.**
    `solidBuildingFootprints` lets an agent under a `building=roof` canopy and a
    `min_height > 0` arch, while `userData.solid` is per CHUNK and a chunk
    cannot say which of its buildings is passable — so a canopy is walkable and
    still swallows the click. Known gap, not an inconsistency to close by making
    canopies solid again.
- **`agentAt()` is where the NEXT order plans from.** Reading the user's
  position for both is what shipped first and made the agent teleport back to
  the start on a second order without moving. `undefined` until the first route
  and again after `clearRoute()`, so the user's position is only the start.
- **`MapControls`, not `OrbitControls` (DEC-5).** Pan-first suits a top-down city
  view. Both ship inside the `three` package the demo already depends on, so
  neither is a new dependency.
- **`guessedHeights` counts BUILDING heights, not terrain**, and the word
  BUILDING in the status line is now MORE load-bearing than when finding M13 was
  raised, not less. It was originally ambiguous because there was no terrain at
  all to confuse it with; since W11 there is, and the status line carries a
  second height (`terrain ±N m`) right next to it. The two numbers answer
  different questions: how many footprints had no `height` tag, and how much
  relief the DEM found.
- **`clearScene()` clears AND repaints.** The view renders on demand, so a clear
  without a repaint would leave the last frame in the drawing buffer with
  nothing to ever overwrite it — the pane would keep showing buildings that are
  no longer anywhere in the app's state.
- **`resize()` repaints too, for the same reason (finding R2-3).** `setSize`
  reallocates the drawing buffer, which CLEARS it, so on an on-demand renderer a
  resize leaves the pane blank until something else schedules a frame. The next
  thing that did was the user dragging the camera — which is how the bug was
  reported: the picture returns the moment you touch it. **Any new caller that
  changes the canvas size must schedule a frame**; the callers are the container
  `ResizeObserver`, the mobile sheet drag and the header collapse, and the sheet
  drag is the harsh one because it calls `resize()` on every pointer move
  (coalescing in `requestFrame` is what keeps that to one frame per animation
  frame).
- **The CANVAS is sized by CSS and the DRAWING BUFFER by `setSize` (W1, finding
  R3-2), and the two must not both be driven from three.** `setSize(w, h, false)`
  writes the width/height attributes — `size x devicePixelRatio`, the buffer —
  and skips `canvas.style`; `index.html`'s `#scene canvas { width: 100%; height:
100% }` supplies the layout box. With neither, the element laid out at its
  attribute size: 2-3x its container on a phone, which puts the projection centre
  (and every orbit pivot) outside the visible box while every pixel assertion
  stays green. Passing `updateStyle: true` as well would write an inline style
  that beats the stylesheet, so the rule would silently stop being the mechanism.
- **The size trigger is a `ResizeObserver` on the CONTAINER, not a `window`
  listener.** The container is the `1fr` row of a `auto 1fr` grid, so it shrinks
  when the header grows — and the header grows with no window resize at all, as
  soon as the status line fills in and wraps. Measured at 1280x800: the drawing
  buffer sat **109 px taller than its container** for the whole session, on a
  stale camera aspect. The observer covers window resize, rotation, the sheet
  drag and the header collapse in one place.
- **The sky texture is a BACKGROUND only. Never assign it to
  `scene.environment`.** W20 did, and it took the entire scene down: three.js
  routes any environment map through its CubeUV path, which expects a
  PMREM-processed texture. Given a raw equirect `DataTexture` it emits integer
  `CUBEUV_*` defines into float assignments, and every `MeshStandardMaterial`
  fragment shader fails to compile with
  `'assign' : cannot convert from 'const int' to 'highp float'`.
  - **three.js does not throw for that** — it logs and silently does not draw
    the material. Buildings, trees, plates and the ground plane all vanished
    while the status line still reported "21 volumes" and the whole suite stayed
    green, because every pixel assertion was satisfied by the one surviving
    `MeshBasicMaterial`, the affordance grid. This is also the real cause of what
    W11 recorded as the plates "known gap".
  - **PMREM was ruled out for a reason that has since expired (N1).** The note
    here read _"PMREM-processing the gradient does not rescue it: the texture is
    one pixel wide, which is degenerate for the equirect-to-cube-UV
    projection"_ — and **W14 widened the sky to 256 × 64 the same day**, so it is
    no longer degenerate. A `PMREMGenerator` pass is available again.
    - **Not taken, deferred (DEC-R5-8).** The round-5 notes ask for a
      better-looking ground and the answer is being searched for by prompt rather
      than guessed at; doing the lighting twice is what is being avoided.
    - **If it is picked up, it needs a draws-anything test** — a difference count
      against a materials-off frame, not an assertion that the field was set. The
      outage was invisible to property assertions.
  - Three other comments in the tree repeated the same wrong claim and were
    corrected with it: `sky-gradient.ts`'s header, the `sky` field docstring, and
    the constructor comment. All three told the next reader to re-add it.
  - The sky-tinted fill the environment map was contributing now comes from a
    `HemisphereLight` whose colours match the gradient's horizon and the ground —
    a light rather than a texture the PBR shader has to sample, so there is no
    shader-compilation surface at all. DEC-R2-1's moving facet edges come from
    the directional light's specular highlight and low roughness, not from an
    environment map.

- **It draws geometry the WORKER built; it no longer builds any.** `render()` used
  to take the merged features and call `buildBuildings`/`buildTrees` itself. Both
  moved into `worker/demo-worker.ts`, because the features are ~21 MB and must
  not cross the boundary to produce geometry that crosses back — the package's
  mesh output is `Float32Array` precisely so the BUFFERS transfer instead. The ENU
  frame anchoring and the terrain sampling moved with them.
  - The invariant that mattered is unchanged: the geometry is still built from
    exactly the features the 2D view scored, because one pipeline still produces
    both. Two fetch paths would let a discrepancy be the data rather than the
    geometry.
- **The package produces buffers; this file makes meshes.** `gps-plus-slam-osm`
  must not depend on `three` (plan §4.2), so it stops at `Float32Array` /
  `Uint32Array` and the consumer does the three lines that follow. That split is
  what made moving the build into a worker a small change rather than a rewrite.
- **Materials are DOUBLE-SIDED on purpose.** A wrongly-wound wall should show up
  as a shading oddity rather than disappear; backface culling would hide exactly
  the class of bug this view is here to find.
- **The ENU frame is anchored at the user, not the tile**, so mesh coordinates
  stay small and float32 vertex buffers stay precise where it matters.
- **Trees arrive in ENU and must be reflected here.** `mergeMeshes` output is
  already in the render frame (`-z` north), but `TreePlacement.position` is a
  placement rather than a buffer and stays ENU (`+y` north). Since W6 the
  reflection is applied by the package's `packInstances`, the same one
  `cell-mesh.ts` applies by hand.
  Skipping it — which this file did until 2026-07-29 — put every tree on the
  wrong side of the origin, 100 m from the building it belongs next to, while
  the forest stayed self-consistent and so read as a data problem.
- **One merged batch is right HERE and wrong in general.** The package's guidance
  is to batch per res-8/res-9 cell, because a batch spanning a 2.81 km fetch tile
  defeats frustum culling. This view shows one working set and is always wholly
  on screen.
- **`guessedHeights` and `approximateRoofs` are surfaced.** They are the mesh
  layer's two honesty flags and this is the only place they become visible —
  which is how the census figures (16 % with `height`, 12 % non-flat roofs) get
  confirmed on real data rather than quoted.
- **OPEN FOLLOW-UP: this view has NO north reference, and that is a real gap.**
  The camera is parked at `(140, 110, 140)` looking at the origin, with nothing
  in the scene naming a compass direction — so a city mirrored north/south looks
  exactly like a correct one.
  - That is not hypothetical. `gps-plus-slam-osm` emitted a left-handed mesh
    frame (ENU north at `+z`) until 2026-07-29, and this view — whose whole job
    is to make the mesh checkable by eye — could not show it. It was found in a
    code review instead, and fixed as a breaking change.
  - Adding a debug axis or a north marker closes the loop that let it through.
    Tracked in
    `GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-07-29-0127-osm-perf-round-followups.md`.
- **The `ResizeObserver` is held in a field and disconnected in `dispose()`.** An
  observer that outlives disposal calls `setSize()` /
  `updateProjectionMatrix()` on a renderer whose GL context has been released.
  Harmless while nothing calls `dispose()`, but the method exists to be called.

## Examples

```ts
const view = new BuildingView({ container });
const stats = view.render(meshFromWorker);
```

## Tests

There is no `building-view.test.ts`: its only subject was `treeConePosition`,
and W6 replaced that with assertions over the real instance matrices in
`mesh-layers.test.ts` — a stronger claim, because they go through the draw path
rather than through a helper it happened to call. The class itself needs a
`WebGLRenderer` and
so cannot be constructed under vitest; the e2e suite exercises it instead. The
geometry it renders is tested in `gps-plus-slam-osm`'s `mesh/buildings.test.ts`
(including the differential triangulation harness against `earcut`) and
`mesh/mesh-orientation.test.ts` (the frame).

`building-view-dispose.test.ts` covers the one part of teardown that can be
reached without a renderer: the **route agent** and the **cell grid** are freed
through the framework's shared `disposeObject3D`
(`gps-plus-slam-app-framework/visualization/three-dispose`) rather than a
private copy. That helper is NOT equivalent to the copy it replaced — it walks
descendants and frees each material's `.map` texture — so the test pins the
preconditions that make the swap safe (both meshes are leaves; no preset's
material carries a texture) before it checks the wiring. Over-disposal here
would blacken whatever else sampled a shared texture, and three.js reports
nothing.

The **repaint-on-resize** invariant has two e2e tests, one per caller:
_"repaints after a viewport resize, without waiting for a camera drag"_ and
_"keeps the 3D view painted while the sheet is dragged"_. Both read the drawing
buffer and count non-background pixels, and **neither may touch the camera** —
any pointer interaction repairs the symptom and makes a broken build pass.

The first one also has to **wait for the scene to go quiescent before
resizing**, by polling `toDataURL()` for two identical reads. Without that it is
flaky in the direction that hides the bug: `waitForRefresh` returns when the
status line says "N cells", but the startup terrain load schedules its own frame
through `setTerrain`, and that frame can land after the resize and repaint for a
reason unrelated to `resize()`. This was observed — the test passed once against
unfixed code before the wait was added.

## The terrain height ramp (W24, DEC-R2-25)

`setGroundDebug(enabled)` swaps the ground plane between its normal reflective
material and a height ramp. `height-ramp.ts` owns the colour arithmetic; this
file owns the material swap and when the colours are refreshed.

- **The ramp material is UNLIT (`MeshBasicMaterial`), and that is why it is a
  second material rather than `vertexColors` on the existing one.** A lit
  material multiplies the vertex colour by the incoming light, so the ramp would
  be modulated by exactly the shading it exists to see past — ground in shadow
  would read as low, the precise misreading the layer is here to eliminate.
- **The heights are SAMPLED FROM THE FIELD, not read back out of the position
  buffer.** This bullet said the opposite until W10; the code's own comment at
  `applyGroundRamp` has been explicit about it for longer. Reading the buffer
  back would only work on the CPU path, since GPU-mode positions stay flat.
- **The colour attribute is WRITTEN INTO, never replaced.** three keys its
  `WebGLBuffer`s off the attribute object and only frees the attributes a
  geometry still holds at dispose time, so replacing it every terrain load
  abandons ~1.9 MB of VRAM per position change — and since the ramp became the
  default (DEC-R5-4) that would be every user, not only someone who opted into a
  diagnostic.
- **`setTerrain` recolours while the ramp is showing.** The ramp is normalised
  over the field's own range, so a new field is a new range; leaving the old
  colours would show the previous position's relief over this position's ground —
  the half-swapped scene this demo has twice had to engineer away.
- **The ground plane FOLLOWS the sampled window, and that is what keeps the GLSL
  offset-free.** `setTerrain` positions the plane at the field's `centreEnu`
  (`groundPositionFor`, exported so `far-field.test.ts` can assert the
  relationship rather than restate it). Two consequences, and both are the
  reason it is done this way:
  - **A plane-local vertex is exactly grid-local**, which is the space the
    height texture is indexed in — so the vertex shader needs no origin-offset
    uniform, and `terrain-texture.ts`'s CPU mirror needs no matching one. The
    plan expected a `uOriginOffsetM` in three places at once; positioning the
    plane removes the question instead of answering it three times.
  - **`heightAt` still speaks the SCENE's frame**, so `setTerrain` and
    `applyGroundRamp` add `centreEnu` back before querying it. Feeding
    plane-local coordinates straight in is precisely the desynchronisation that
    made this worth threading through, and it is silent: each surface stays
    internally smooth while the two part company by the walked distance.
  - **A failed load moves the plane too, and the earlier reasoning for not doing
    so was wrong.** It said moving a flat plane is invisible — true, and beside
    the point: the plane is FINITE. It reaches `TERRAIN_EXTENT_M` from its centre
    and stops, so one left behind during a DEM outage stops covering the user as
    soon as they walk past that, leaving them off the edge of the world with no
    ground at all — and the 5 km re-anchor threshold puts that well inside a
    single anchor. `setTerrain` therefore takes the window centre SEPARATELY from
    the field, because the field is `undefined` in exactly that case. Raised in
    review on #269.
- **It is a GROUND MODE, not a layer (W6, DEC-R5-4).** It used to be
  `terrainDebug` in `ALL_LAYERS`, applied from the layer set in `main.ts`, with a
  bespoke `layer-order.ts` entry returning 0 and a bespoke "greyed out under No
  ground" rule — four special cases for one entry, which is what finally said it
  did not belong there. `ground-mode.ts` owns it now, and `main.ts` drives it
  from `groundShowsRamp(mode)`.
- **DEC-R2-1 is not violated, and the argument changed.** That decision rejected
  a hypsometric ramp as the _primary_ look. It **is** the default appearance now
  (DEC-R5-4, which overrides DEC-R4-5), so what keeps the decision intact is that
  the plain reflective ground stays one click away and the e2e asserts the
  round-trip — not that the ramp is off.

## The underground layer

`renderUnderground(outlines)` draws the excluded features as line segments below
the terrain. The outlines arrive **already in ENU**, packed x,y per point by the
worker.

**The geometry and material are built in [`underground-lines.ts`](./underground-lines.ts.md)**,
not here. This view needs a WebGL context to construct, so anything assembled
inside it can only be checked by an e2e — and an e2e can see that lines appeared
without being able to say whether they are transparent, at the right depth, or
whether a node became a tick rather than nothing. Each of those broke once.

**Cleanup is shared by three callers** — `renderUnderground`, `clearScene` and
`dispose` — through one private helper. These lines live outside `this.group`,
so they escape the group teardown; three copies of the same four lines is how
one of them ends up missing, which is what review on #256 found.

**Why the worker converts.** The ENU frame lives there, as it does for every
other piece of scene geometry, and `recentre` invalidates every ENU coordinate —
so a page-side copy of the frame would go stale exactly when the user moves.

**A FIXED DEPTH, not the feature's real one.** OSM's `layer` is an ordering and
`level` is a storey index; neither is a distance, so deriving metres from them
would be a fabricated elevation. `UNDERGROUND_DEPTH_M` is an honest "this is
underneath".

**Nodes get a vertical tick.** A node has no outline, and "a segment needs two
ends" silently dropped them — from the one view meant to reveal what was
dropped. The corpus fixture's only below-surface feature is exactly such a node,
which is how the gap was found.

**Depth testing is off and `RENDER_ORDER.underground` is above both affordance
layers**, because the lines are drawn below the terrain and would otherwise be
occluded by the very ground they exist to be seen under. The material is also
**transparent**, and that is load-bearing: three draws the opaque list first and
`renderOrder` only sorts within a list, so an opaque line outranked the
affordance slabs in the table while losing to them on screen.

## `suspend()` / `resume()` — the desktop renderer while AR runs (M5)

**Hidden but resident**, which §3 of the AR plan decided rather than left open.
The GL context, the compiled programs, the uploaded geometry and every setting
survive; only the loop and the visibility stop. Two live GL contexts on the
phone is the accepted cost, and what buys it is an **instant** return to the map
instead of rebuilding a 2.8 km mesh.

- **The guard is inside `requestFrame`, not at the call sites.** A dozen paths
  reach it — a terrain load landing, a snapshot publishing, a resize, a camera
  change — and a suspended view can still be driven down any of them. Guarding
  the call sites is a list the next one added will not be on.
- **A pending frame is CANCELLED, not merely un-scheduled.** `requestFrame`
  coalesces, so a callback can already be in flight when AR starts; left alone
  it renders the desktop scene once, on the frame after the session began, for
  nothing.
- **`visibility`, never `display`.** A `display: none` canvas has a zero-sized
  box and this class observes its container with a `ResizeObserver`, so hiding
  that way resizes the drawing buffer to 0×0 — and returning from AR finds a
  renderer sized for an element that had no size. Blank pane, no error.
- **`resume()` schedules a frame explicitly**, because the scene is static and
  frames are on demand: nothing else would repaint it, and the pane would stay
  as it was when the session started — which, having been hidden, means blank.
- Both are idempotent, and `resume()` is safe without a prior `suspend()`.

`main.ts` calls them from `startWalking` / `stopWalking`, the two functions both
AR exits already pass through — including the Android back gesture, where
nothing calls `ArMode.dispose()`. `ar-walk-wiring.test.ts` pins that pairing by
location; `building-view-content.test.ts` pins the four invariants above.

## `setFarPlane()` — the render-distance dial (r541 Q9/Q10)

A **debug instrument, not a new default.** `FAR_PLANE_M` is unchanged and
`far-field.test.ts` still pins the shipped view; passing `FAR_PLANE_M` restores
it exactly, and the control is inert at 1x.

- `setFarPlane(farPlaneM: number): void` — writes `camera.far`, calls
  `updateProjectionMatrix()`, and moves **both** fog terms. Non-finite or
  non-positive input is ignored rather than applied: the value reaches the
  projection matrix, where a `NaN` renders nothing and raises no error.
- `farPlaneM(): number` — read back from the **camera**.
- `fogNearM(): number` — read back from the **fog**.

**Why the fog moves with it.** `THREE.Fog` is linear and built with
`far = FAR_PLANE_M`, so every fragment past it is already fully fog coloured.
Moving the camera alone draws more geometry and shows the identical image — a
control that reports "nothing changed" about the engine when it is only true of
itself. Not a new discovery: `far-field.test.ts` already asserts the
relationship and calls it "the specific way raising the far plane alone goes
wrong".

**Why the ground plane does NOT move.** Seeing empty scene past its edge is
acceptable (owner decision, 2026-08-21). Seeing **invented** terrain is not, and
widening the plane past the height field is how that happens: `surfaceHeight`
clamps its sample index per axis and the GPU path uses `ClampToEdgeWrapping`, so
the edge profile extrudes outward as stripes that read as relief and are
fabricated — finding R2-9, named in `moveGroundTo`. So this method touches the
camera and the fog and nothing else.

**Why the readbacks exist.** The debug readout is painted from them, never from
the slider, so it reports what the projection matrix actually holds. A readout
fed from the requested value would keep saying 24000 while a `setFarPlane` that
had stopped writing the camera did nothing — and the e2e that asserts the text
would pass against it.

**Where the arithmetic lives:** `main.ts`, not here. `render-distance.ts` reads
`FAR_PLANE_M` from this module, so importing it back would be a cycle that
`check:cycles` rejects. `setFarPlane` therefore takes plain metres.

**Tests:** `scene-3d.spec.js`, "the render-distance dial moves the camera AND the
fog, and is inert at 1x". It cannot be a unit test — `BuildingView` constructs a
`WebGLRenderer`, as `building-view-content.test.ts` records.

**Known limits, RAISED to match the boot default (DEC-K2, 2026-08-22).** Both
were derived from the 1x baseline and were acceptable while the dial was a debug
opt-in; once the page booted at 2x they capped the shipped app instead, and the
field ask that raised the default was literally about zooming further out.

- `MAX_CAMERA_DISTANCE_M` 1200 → **2400** — half the boot far plane, because the
  camera is tilted and a limit at the far plane itself would still clip the
  horizon. The map zoom now reaches half the drawn distance rather than a
  quarter. The wheel-dolly path still has no cap.
- `url-state`'s `MAX_DISTANCE_M` 2400 → **4800** — the boot far plane, so a
  far-out view can be shared by link instead of being silently truncated.
- ⚠️ **Both track the DEFAULT multiplier, not the live one.** Turning the dial
  down to 1x leaves each past that far plane, so a fully zoomed-out map can clip
  and a restored link can land on nothing. Accepted deliberately: the recovery
  is visible and immediate (zoom back in, or turn the dial up), whereas a
  silently truncated share link is neither.
