/**
 * The demo's store — the one thing every view reads.
 *
 * Why these tests matter:
 * The framework slice is already tested; what is untested until here is the
 * BINDING — that the demo mounts it under a key its selectors agree on, that
 * `DemoSnapshot` survives RTK's serialisability check, and that a subscriber
 * fires exactly when the thing it draws has changed. The last one is the whole
 * reason the store exists: a subscriber that fires on every dispatch redraws
 * ~931 Leaflet polygons when the user ticks a checkbox, and one that never
 * fires is the stale map this round is fixing.
 *
 * @see osm-store.ts.md
