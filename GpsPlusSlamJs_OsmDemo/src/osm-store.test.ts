/**
 * The demo's store — the one thing every view reads.
 *
 * Why these tests matter:
 * The framework slice is already tested; what is untested until here is the
 * BINDING — that the demo mounts it under a key its selectors agree on, that
 * `DemoSnapshot` survives RTK's serialisability check, and that a subscriber
 * fires exactly when the thing it draws has changed. The last one is the whole
 * reason the store exists: a subscriber that fires on every dispatch redraws
 * ~931 Leaflet polygons when the user ticks a checkbox, and one that never
 * fires is the stale map this round is fixing.

/**
 * The store migration to `createSlamAppStore` (AR milestone 1).
 *
 * Why these tests matter: the migration was described in this file's own source
 * as "a one-line change" for a year, and it was not. The framework's factory
 * hardcoded its dev-check exemptions, so adopting it naively would have
 * reintroduced a **measured 71 ms per dispatch** — the deep serialisability
 * walk over ~931 scored cells — in exactly the builds someone uses to judge
 * whether the app feels fast. That regression is invisible: nothing fails, the
 * app just gets slower in development.
 *
 * So the exemption is pinned, and so is the framework state AR needs, because
 * "the store still works" is not the property the migration was for.
