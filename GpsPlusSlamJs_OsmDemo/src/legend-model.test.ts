/**
 * The legend's view model — what the colours actually mean.
 *
 * Why these tests matter:
 * The demo shipped with no legend at all, and the one sentence that stood in
 * for one ("above 1, the identity is 1, up to 8, log scale…") was reported as
 * incomprehensible. It is not decoration — it is the on-screen answer to
 * iteration 8's second question, whether unbounded scores are practically
 * thresholdable — so it is being replaced rather than deleted (DEC-13), and the
 * replacement has to carry the same claim.
 *
 * Two things here are load-bearing beyond "it renders". The legend must NAME the
 * category, because without that a redraw that changed every colour slightly is
 * indistinguishable from no redraw at all — the M2 report. And the three
 * sub-threshold bands (DEC-7) must stay distinguishable, because telling a hard
 * veto apart from "nothing known" is the entire point of revealing them.
 *
