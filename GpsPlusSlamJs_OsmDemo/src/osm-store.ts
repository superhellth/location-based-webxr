/**
 * The demo's store: one state, four views.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS NOW AND DID NOT BEFORE. With two write-only views and one
 * input, `main.ts` driving both imperatively was the simpler and more debuggable
 * design, and `demo-pipeline.ts` said so. Round-1 feedback added a legend, a
 * details panel, a selected cell that three views must agree on, and a
 * below-threshold toggle that changes what two of them draw. Wiring four views
 * to each other is six edges, every one of which is a place the panel can end up
 * explaining a cell the map is no longer showing. One store is four edges and no
 * ordering question.
 *
 * WHAT STAYS OUT OF IT. Raw `OsmFeature` maps, Leaflet layers, three.js objects.
 * RTK throws on non-serialisable state in development, and the merged features
 * are a `Map` — they stay in `DemoPipeline`, which is also where they are
 * cheapest to keep. The store holds scored data and ids.
 *
 * WHY THE VIEWS DO NOT IMPORT IT. Each view keeps a plain `render(...)` taking
 * the data it draws, and this module's `subscribe` calls them. A view that
 * imported the store would be untestable without one and would know about state
 * it has no business reading — the seam that makes "is the data wrong or the
 * drawing wrong?" answerable is the same seam that makes the views mockable.
 *
 * @see osm-store.ts.md

   * 2026-08-12 the factory hardcoded its dev-check exemptions to the

   * exemptions to its own, which is what makes this migration honest rather
   * than a silent regression.
   *
   * WHY MIGRATE AT ALL: AR mode reads the framework's GPS state. The origin
   * comes from `selectZeroReference`, and `enableArWorldGroupAlignment`
   * subscribes to the alignment matrix — neither exists in a store holding
   * only this demo's view slice.
