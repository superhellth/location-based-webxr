 * Why these tests matter: every failure this milestone can produce is SILENT.
 * A session that starts without a GPS fix anchors the city to nothing; content
 * attached to `arWorldGroup` instead of the scene root pins it to the session's
 * arbitrary start pose; content attached without the frame argument renders it
 * 90° off; and content left on the framework's scene at teardown vanishes from
 * the desktop view, because the framework discards that scene at session end.
 * None of those throw.
 *
 * The framework's session module is mocked, following the reference consumer
 * (`WayfindingHudDemo/src/ar-mode.test.ts`): a real `initAR` needs a WebXR
 * device, and what this module is responsible for is the WIRING either side of
 * it.

   * Why these tests matter: the descent moves the whole city on the same axis
   * the auto-elevation estimator and the manual trim already move it. The curve
   * is proven in `ar-descent.test.ts`; what only this file can prove is that it
   * reaches `attachContentTo` as a COMPOSED term rather than as its own write —
   * the "typechecks but never renders" gap, and here also the "gets clobbered by
   * the next auto tick" gap that `applyElevation` setting-rather-than-
   * accumulating creates. Those two ARE pinned here: mutating the descent so it
   * never sinks fails three of these.
   *
   * MUTATION-VERIFIED, and the route there is worth recording because the first
   * conclusion was wrong. A descent that never lands — `DESCENT_FALL_S` raised
   * so the fall outlives the session — fails three of these, including the
   * landing signal. An entry move that never sinks fails three others.
   *
   * **But mutating `if (t >= 1) return 0;` to `return start` changes nothing
   * here, and that is NOT a gap in these tests.** That branch is unreachable
   * through the frame loop: `1 - smoothstep(t)` underflows to exactly 0 a frame
   * BEFORE `t` reaches 1, so the descent reports complete and the block stops
   * before that line can run. The branch still matters for a caller that skips
   * frames, and `ar-descent.test.ts` covers it directly at `end + 60`.
   *
   * The lesson, since half an hour went into it: **a surviving mutant is not
   * evidence of a weak test until the mutant is shown to be reachable.**
