/**
 * WHICH FETCH TILES A GEO-EVENT SEARCH ACTUALLY NEEDS (W7 follow-up).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. W7's benchmark showed a search downloading tiles right after
 * a refresh at the widest radius, and the obvious objection is a good one: a
 * res-7 fetch tile is over 3 km across, so a search that only wanders ~1 km
 * around the user should never leave the one already in hand. This file settles
 * it with H3 arithmetic — no OSM data, no network, no fixture heat, just "which
 * fetch tile does this cell belong to".
 *
 * WHAT IT FOUND, and it is a defect rather than a cost. `DemoPipeline.geoEvent`
 * admitted a neighbouring event tile when **that tile's own fetch tile** was
 * already loaded, and its docstring gives the reason: "a neighbour whose data is
 * missing costs an 18–110 s download… the rest are skipped". But the ensure set
 * built for an admitted neighbour reaches ~550 m past its centre in every
 * direction, into fetch tiles nobody checked — so the download it promised to
 * skip happened anyway. The gate tested the centre; the work needs the reach.
 *
 * **THE GATE NOW ASKS ABOUT THE REACH**, so the tests below are a guard rather
 * than a report. `searchAt` deliberately keeps modelling the OLD rule, because
 * the magnitude of what it let through is the reason the new one exists — and a
 * test that only exercised the current rule could not show that.
 *
 * It runs at the demo's own default position, Central Park South, because that
 * is where the 5–10 s was reported and because tile geometry is positional.
