/**
 * The plus/minus elevation control in the AR overlay (DEC-E1).
 *
 * **Why it is a separate module from the HUD.** The HUD is a read-only readout
 * sampled twice a second; this is interactive, lives for the session, and owns a
 * value. Folding a control into a formatter would make the value untestable
 * without a frame loop.
 *
 * **The `#ar-root` trap, which this follows the HUD in avoiding.** That element
 * is `position: fixed; inset: 0` and is hidden only while `:empty`, so anything
 * left attached keeps a full-viewport layer over the page whenever AR is not
 * running — a regression that has shipped here once already. So the control
 * attaches on {@link ArElevationControl.attach} and removes itself on
 * {@link ArElevationControl.dispose}, and is never attached speculatively.
 *
 * @see ar-elevation-control.ts.md
