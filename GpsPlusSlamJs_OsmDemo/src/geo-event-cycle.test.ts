/**
 * The geo-event cycle's four hazards: the busy state, a rejection, a stale
 * answer, and the republish.
 *
 * WHY THESE TESTS MATTER. All four were unreachable before this module existed.
 * The geo-event lived as a closure in `main.ts`, which cannot be unit-tested, so
 * the only covered part of a 5–10 s operation was the pure label arithmetic in
 * `event-label.ts`. The two that had already gone wrong in production are here:
 * a failure routed through `fetchFailed`, which blanks the whole map for an
 * outcome that says nothing about the data (DEC-W2a); and the missing republish,
 * which is why the probed cells and the fetched tiles never reached the map at
 * all (W1, G6/G7).
