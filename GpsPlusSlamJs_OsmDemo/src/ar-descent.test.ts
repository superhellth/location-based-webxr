 * auto-elevation estimator and the manual trim already move it. Three properties
 * carry the feature — it holds, it lands exactly at zero, and it never produces
 * a value that could put the scene somewhere unrecoverable. The last one is not
 * defensive padding: `applyElevation` writes this straight into the position the
 * city is drawn at, and a NaN there raises no error anywhere. The failure would
 * read as "AR is empty", which is indistinguishable from several other causes.
