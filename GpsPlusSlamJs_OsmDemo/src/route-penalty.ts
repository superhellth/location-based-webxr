/**
 * What an affordance score costs a route (DEC-R13-1, DEC-R13-11 … DEC-R13-13).
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE. The ninth testing session asked for "a mixture of
 * optimal direct distance and orienting on the tiles with the highest weights",
 * and the ratio between those two IS the behaviour — it is the difference
 * between an NPC that cuts across the grass and one that follows the park paths.
 * A number that decides a behaviour users describe in words deserves a file, a
 * name, and tests, not a literal inside a cost function.
 *
 * THREE DECISIONS LIVE HERE, and each was taken against a plausible alternative:
 *
 * - **which category** (DEC-R13-11). `CellScore.scores` is keyed by category and
 *   the demo OPENS on `battleArea` (DEC-G3 — the geo-event is the headline
 *   feature and "a geo-event for walkable?" read as nonsense). A planner reading
 *   the selected category would therefore route the shipped default by
 *   battle-area suitability. This module names `walkable` and ignores the UI.
 * - **what an unscored cell costs** (DEC-R13-12, amending DEC-R13-2). Not 1.
 *   One is also the admissibility floor, so "unscored costs 1" would make
 *   unknown ground at least as cheap as the best mapped path and strictly
 *   cheaper than ordinary grass — giving A\* a standing incentive to route
 *   AROUND the ~326 m scored disk, the inverse of what was asked for. An
 *   unscored cell is the score IDENTITY instead, which is the same `?? 1` the
 *   heat scale already applies to a cell with no entry in a category.
 * - **what the log is measured against** (DEC-R13-13). Fixed constants, NOT a
 *   maximum derived from whatever is currently scored. Such a maximum moves on
 *   every pan, and a moving baseline means the same click gives a different
 *   route after the working set grows — a flake generator for the corpus test
 *   and an irreproducible user bug report, in the same round that adds
 *   camera-target URLs so a finding can be pointed at.
 *
 *   **THE COLOURS HAVE SINCE FOLLOWED THIS FILE (DEC-H5).** The snapshot's
 *   derived `heatMax` is gone; `heat-colours.ts` now anchors on a fixed
 *   `HEAT_CAP` for exactly the reason recorded here, one round later and about
 *   pixels instead of paths. Note the two anchors are **not** the same number —
 *   `PATH_SCORE` is 5 000 and `HEAT_CAP` is 1e4 — and they answer different
 *   questions: one is "what does a good path cost", the other "where does the
 *   ramp top out". Neither is derived from the other, and a future round that
 *   wants them unified has to argue it rather than assume it.

 * Central Park, da wo eben die Wege langgehen"). Anything above it clamps, so
 * the 24 000s are not preferred over the 5 000s — past "this is definitely a
 * path" there is nothing left to buy, and letting the top of the range keep

 * makes the NPC hug the footways; turning it down towards 1 makes it walk
 * straight lines again, which is precisely the "he does not prefer the paths"
 * complaint this round answers.
 *
 * **IT IS ALSO THE EXPANSION DIAL, and that is the non-obvious half.** The A\*
 * heuristic is unpenalised metres while edges cost metres × penalty, so the
 * larger this is the looser the guidance and the more the search behaves like
 * Dijkstra. `agent-route.test.ts` pins the expansion cost at the shipped value;

 * heuristic stays a lower bound only while this cannot dip below 1.
 *
 * Log-linear between the two anchors, because the scores span five orders of
 * magnitude (0.2 … 24 000 in the session's own examples) and a linear map would

 * metres, which is a lower bound only while every edge costs at least its own
 * metres. Any factor below 1 would destroy that and make A* return
 * non-optimal routes that still look plausible — the worst kind of wrong,
