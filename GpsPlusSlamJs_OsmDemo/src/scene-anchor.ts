/**
 * The scene anchor — where the ENU frame's origin sits, and when it moves.
 *
 * The demo used to derive its origin from the user's current position on every
 * publish, so **every vertex in the scene moved whenever the user did**. The AR
 * framework's origin is the opposite: `setZeroPos` sets `zero` once per session
 * and never again, and every GPS observation is stored relative to it. Geometry
 * built the old way could therefore never share a scene with AR content — it
 * would shift wholesale on every refresh while the AR content stayed put.
 *
 * So the origin is now a property of the SCENE, not of the current position.
 *
 * **Two rules, because two things can move the user and they differ in kind:**
 *
 * - **A declared place change re-anchors unconditionally.** Choosing a site is
 *   a discontinuity, not travel. The picker spans Cologne to Tokyo — ~9 000 km
 *   — where the frame's fixed longitude scale is wrong by ~29 %, so the city
 *   would be sheared into unrecognisable geometry rather than merely offset.
 * - **Ordinary navigation re-anchors only past {@link REANCHOR_THRESHOLD_M}.**
 *   A step, a drag or a locate keeps the origin, which is the entire point.
 *
 * @see scene-anchor.ts.md

 * How far the user may travel before the origin is re-taken, in metres.

 * **5 km, the conservative end of the owner's ~5–10 km range (DEC-R11-7).** It
 * never fires during a walk or a normal map drag, and it halves the worst-case
 * frame distortion against the 10 km end.
 *
 * The error this bounds is **not** float32 — that term is negligible here, a
 * fraction of a millimetre at the demo's whole extent. It is the equirectangular
 * approximation in `enuFrameAt`, which fixes the longitude scale at the origin's
 * latitude: the easting error grows as roughly `tan(φ₀)·Δφ`, giving ~1 m at
 * 2.4 km and ~19 m at 10 km.
 *
 * That figure is against **true geodesy**, not against the AR content: the
 * framework's own `calcRelativeCoordsInMeters` makes the identical
 * approximation with the same fixed cosine, so both subsystems are wrong in
 * precisely the same way — which is what makes them agree with each other.
 * Locally the residual is a scale error of ~0.2 % at a 10 km offset, about half
 * a metre across a city block.

 * single decision point that every consumer reads afterwards fixes it
 * structurally — and this codebase has now watched the same "the consumers of
 * the frame must move together" constraint be violated three times by being
 * written down rather than enforced.
 *
 * @param start the resolved start position. The demo has no GPS path, so this
