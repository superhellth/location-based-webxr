/**
 * The geo-event cycle: a press in, an event out, and a republish behind it.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A MODULE RATHER THAN A CLOSURE IN `main.ts`. Same reason
 * `explain-cycle.ts` gives, and it applies harder here: this is the demo's
 * longest action (5–10 s with the OSM data already cached), it has a busy state,
 * a terminal label, a failure path and a follow-up refresh, and none of the four
 * was covered while it lived in the app shell — which cannot be unit-tested at
 * all. `refresh-cycle.ts`, `terrain-cycle.ts` and `explain-cycle.ts` are the
 * established pattern.
 *
 * WHY IT REPUBLISHES (W1, and the whole of G6/G7). `DemoPipeline.geoEvent` has
 * two lasting effects on worker state: it scores the cells around every
 * candidate, and it adds the tiles it had to fetch to `loaded`. Both would be
 * carried by the NEXT snapshot — but the RPC returns only the `GeoEvent` and
 * nothing asked for a next snapshot, so the probed cells never appeared on the
 * map and the red fetch rectangles never grew. A winner sitting outside them was
 * the reported symptom, and it was the honest picture of a stale overlay.
 *
 * WHY THE REPUBLISH IS THE FULL REFRESH (DEC-W1a). A single `update` at the
 * widest radius would be about a third of the work, but it would be a SECOND
 * publish path: `refresh-cycle.ts` dispatches `fetchStarted`, orders the mesh
 * before the snapshot so the 3D view never draws new cells over an old city, and
 * is `latestOnly` so a superseded run cannot land after the run that replaced
 * it. Duplicating three rules to save ~1.9 s on an action that just spent five
 * seconds is the wrong trade.
 *
 * WHY A FAILURE IS NOT `fetchFailed` (DEC-W2a). It used to be, "so a geo-event
 * failure is as visible as a fetch failure" — but `fetchFailed` clears the
 * snapshot and all three selections, so a transient Overpass error during a Find
 * blanked a map that was still entirely correct. A failed search says nothing
 * about whether the data on screen is good, which is exactly the split
 * `nonFatalError` exists for. Same reasoning as the locate control's refused
 * permission, one file over.
 *
 * WHY A STALE ANSWER IS DROPPED. The search is long enough to change the
 * category picker twice over, and the event was computed against the old
 * category's scores and its threshold. Drawing it over the new category's map is
 * the cross-view disagreement the store was introduced to make impossible — and
 * once a category change clears the markers (W2), a late arrival would silently
 * put them back.
 *
