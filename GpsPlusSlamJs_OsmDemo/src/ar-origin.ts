 * Where AR mode anchors the city, and the two conversions it needs.

 * **WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE.** Both conversions are one-liners and both are
 * the kind of one-liner that is wrong for months: the framework says `lon` and
 * this demo says `lng`, and the geoid turns an orthometric DEM height into the
 * ellipsoidal one the GPS-world frame is measured in. Neither has a natural
 * home in `ar-mode.ts` (which owns a session lifecycle) and both need testing
 * without a WebXR session, a renderer or a DOM.
 *
 * **THE ORIGIN IS THE FRAMEWORK'S `zero`, NOT THE DEMO'S POSITION** (DEC-R11-6).
 * The demo picks a start position from a place-picker and moves it on every map
 * click; the framework's `zero` is taken from the first GPS fix and is immutable
 * for the session. AR must use the latter, because the alignment matrix the
 * fusion produces is expressed against it — anchoring the mesh anywhere else
 * means the camera and the city disagree by however far the two have drifted.
 *
 * `zero` is `null` until a fix arrives, and that is why AR entry WAITS rather
 * than falling back to the map position. DEC-R11-6 rejected re-anchoring on the
 * first non-null `zero`, so entering early and correcting later is not
 * available: there is nothing to correct to.

/**
 * The datum AR asks the worker for, given the geoid undulation at the origin.
 *
 * Returns the value `terrain-field.ts` wants as `absoluteDatum`, so the caller
 * never has to remember the sign. `heightAt` computes `surfaceHeight − datum`,
 * so producing an ellipsoidal height from an orthometric DEM means subtracting
 * `−N`, i.e. the datum is the NEGATED undulation.
 *
 * **The sign is the whole content of this function and the reason it exists.**
 * Getting it backwards puts the city ~2N — about 94 m at Cologne — out of
 * place, in the direction that reads as a GPS+SLAM fusion bug rather than as an
 * elevation one, which is a much more expensive place to go looking. That
 * warning is `geoid.ts`'s, and it is why the demo pays for a function instead
 * of writing a minus sign at the call site.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THIS FUNCTION IS HALF OF A HANDSHAKE, and the other half is untested.**
 * Converting the DEM to ellipsoidal is only correct because the frame it has to
 * meet — the fusion's Up axis — is ellipsoidal too, and that is true only
 * because Android/Chrome reports `GeolocationCoordinates.altitude` against the
 * ellipsoid. Nothing in the framework or the library normalises it; see the
 * comment on `altitude:` in `GpsPlusSlamJs_AppFramework/src/sensors/gps.ts`.
 *
 * So if iOS support is ever added and its altitude turns out to be orthometric,
 * this conversion becomes the thing that doubles the error rather than cancels
 * it: the DEM would be raised by N while the GPS side stayed at MSL, putting the
 * city ~2N — about 94 m at Cologne — out of place. That is the SAME magnitude
 * and the same misleading signature as getting the sign below backwards. Fix it
 * at the sensor boundary so this function keeps its single, checkable meaning.

 *
 * - **`terrainHasData` is gated only on a field EXISTING.** A failed or
 *   all-missing load returns `flat(...)`, which hardcodes `datum: 0` whatever
 *   undulation was requested (`heightfield.ts`). So for any non-zero undulation
 *   — −46.2 at Cologne — {@link fieldMatchesArDatum} necessarily rejects the
 *   failed field. Gating `hasData` behind it therefore suppressed
 *   `terrainHasData: false` **exactly when the DEM had failed**, i.e. precisely
 *   when the alarm should fire. `ar-measurements.ts` calls that flag "THE MOST
 *   IMPORTANT FLAG IN THIS INTERFACE" and shows `terrain: no DEM` in the
 *   always-visible collapsed set so a silent terrain failure cannot pass as
 *   flat ground; gated, the line vanished instead, which reads as "not landed
 *   yet" — the same silence the flag exists to break.
 * - **`terrainHeightM` keeps the datum gate**, unchanged. Between AR entry and
 *   the entry pass landing the held field is still the DESKTOP one, sampled
 *   against the window-centre height, so its `heightAt` returns RELIEF rather
 *   than an ellipsoidal height. Publishing that prints a confident residual
 *   tens of metres out — the same magnitude as the symptom the residual exists
 *   to diagnose.
 *
 * The mismatch invalidates the HEIGHT, never the hasData CLAIM. Returning
 * nothing at all before any field exists is deliberate: "no field yet" is
 * genuinely unknown, and publishing `false` there would raise the DEM alarm
 * during ordinary startup.
 *
 * Extracted from the `liveMeasurements` closure in `main.ts` so it can be
 * tested. The predicate was covered in isolation while the payload consuming it
 * was not, which is how the defect passed review.
