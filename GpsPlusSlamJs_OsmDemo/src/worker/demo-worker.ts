/**
 * The worker: everything expensive in the demo, off the UI thread.
 *
 * WHAT LIVES HERE AND WHY. All four of the demo's costly operations, because all
 * four blocked the UI before this existed:
 *
 * - **Fetch and parse.** An Overpass response for one res-7 tile is ~21 MB of
 *   JSON. `resolutions.ts` said outright that "it is why parsing belongs in a
 *   worker" — this is that worker.
 * - **Scoring.** 19 res-11 chunks, 931 res-13 cells, one synchronous pass.
 * - **The mesh build.** Its output is `Float32Array`/`Uint32Array` precisely so it
 *   can **transfer** rather than copy (`mesh/extrude.ts` says so), which only
 *   pays off across a boundary like this one.
 * - **DEM sampling.** ~55 000 posts once the terrain covers the rendered extent.
 *
 * THIS IS THE FIRST CONSUMER TO EXERCISE ANY OF IT. `gps-plus-slam-osm`
 * documents itself as worker-safe in six places and shapes its public types
 * around the constraint (structured-cloneable only, no class instances crossing),
 * and until now nothing had ever tested that. Treat the claim as newly verified.
 *
 * WHY THE HEIGHTFIELD IS HELD HERE rather than passed in with each mesh request.
 * The buildings, the trees and (later) the ground layers all have to stand on the
 * SAME surface, and the surface is per-position while the mesh is rebuilt per
 * category change too. Holding it worker-side means one owner and no possibility
 * of the main thread sending a stale field back — which is the exact class of bug
 * `terrain-cycle.ts` was written to prevent when both lived on the main thread.
 *
 * WHY OPFS STILL WORKS. `navigator.storage.getDirectory()` is available in
 * workers, so the tile cache moves here with the fetching rather than staying
 * behind — and a worker is the better home for it, since OPFS offers synchronous
 * access handles only off the main thread.
 *
 * @see demo-worker.ts.md

 * Buffers to hand over rather than copy, per request kind.
 *
 * WHY PER KIND AND NOT A BLANKET SWEEP. Transferring **detaches** a buffer on this
 * side, so it may only be done for data the worker does not keep:
 *
 * - **update** — the mesh comes from `chunkMeshes`, freshly allocated per call and
 *   never retained here, so handing it over is free. This is the payload that
 *   matters: the building geometry is the largest thing that crosses.
 * - **terrain** — the field's `heights` MUST NOT be transferred. That same object
 *   stays in module state for the next mesh build, and detaching it would leave the
 *   worker holding a zero-length array. Buildings would silently drop to flat ground
 *   on the following refresh, which reads as a terrain bug rather than as a
 *   memory-ownership one.
 * - **init / explain** — small plain objects with nothing worth transferring.
 *
 * Until this existed the package's `Float32Array` output was only transfer**able**,
 * while four docstrings claimed the transfer itself as the payoff of the worker
 * split. Raised in review on #228: the docs asserted a property the code lacked.
