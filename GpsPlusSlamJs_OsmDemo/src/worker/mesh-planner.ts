/**
 * "Has anything the geometry depends on changed since the last full build?"
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (W6, finding R3-3). Progressive scoring runs three passes per
 * click, and the first version rebuilt the ENTIRE city on every one of them —
 * buildings, trees, POI markers, roads, plates — although only the region slabs
 * differ between rings. That was most of the per-click cost the round-3 notes
 * reported as "the calculation just takes longer", and it was recorded as a
 * known cost in `refresh-cycle.ts` for a round before being fixed.
 *
 * WHAT THE GEOMETRY ACTUALLY DEPENDS ON, which is the whole content of this
 * module:
 *
 * - **the position**, because the mesh is built in an ENU frame anchored there,
 *   so every vertex in the scene moves when the user does;
 * - **the feature set**, which grows only by loading another fetch tile;
 * - **the terrain**, because every builder samples heights from it.
 *
 * A widening ring changes none of them. Neither does a category change — which
 * is a second, unlooked-for win: switching category used to rebuild the city too.
 *
 * WHY A COUNTER FOR THE TILES AND A STAMP FOR THE TERRAIN. Both are "has this
 * been replaced?" questions rather than "what is it?" questions, and comparing
 * the things themselves would mean deep-comparing megabytes of features and a
 * 55 000-post field on every pass — more expensive than the rebuild being
 * avoided. Tiles are only ever ADDED, so a count is faithful; the terrain is
 * replaced wholesale, so a monotonic stamp is.
 *
 * @see mesh-planner.ts.md
