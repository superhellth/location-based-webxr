/**
 * One background tile at a time, dropped the moment the user leaves (W8).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Crossing a res-7 fetch-tile boundary costs an 18–110 s
 * Overpass request for 28–68 MB, and nothing tells the user which click will pay
 * it — which is most of what the round-3 notes called "undeterministisch". The
 * answer, decided in round 2 as DEC-R2-6 and carried here as W8, is to pull the
 * six neighbouring tiles in the background so the boundary crossing is already
 * paid for.
 *
 * **The cost is accepted with the number stated: 170–400 MB per move against
 * donated Overpass infrastructure.** Throttling spreads that total over time; it
 * does not reduce it. That is why every discipline below is load-bearing rather
 * than tidy:
 *
 * - **One request in flight, ever.** The public instances allocate ~2 slots per
 *   client and the user's own fetch needs one of them.
 * - **The user's fetch is never queued behind a prefetch.** `replace` is called
 *   after the visible work, and a prefetch that is running when the user moves is
 *   ABORTED rather than awaited.
 * - **Abandoned areas are dropped, not finished.** `replace` states the whole
 *   desired set; anything not in it is discarded, including the in-flight tile.
 * - **Nothing is requested twice.** Already-loaded tiles are skipped, and a tile
 *   that is queued or in flight is not queued again.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: hand the result to the index. A prefetched
 * tile is written to the OPFS blob store by `CachingSource` and stops there, so
 * the next click parses it from disk in seconds instead of fetching it in
 * minutes — while the in-memory feature set stays limited to ground the user has
 * actually reached. Merging every prefetched tile would multiply the worker's
 * memory by seven for data that may never be looked at.
 *
