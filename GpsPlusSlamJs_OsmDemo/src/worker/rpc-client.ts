/**
 * The main-thread half of the worker boundary: correlated, abortable calls.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT JUST `postMessage`. A worker is a message bus, not a function
 * call, and every property a caller expects from `await` has to be built:
 *
 * - **Correlation.** Replies arrive on one channel in whatever order the worker
 *   finishes, so each call carries an id and resolves its own promise.
 * - **Failure.** An exception inside a worker rejects nothing here. If the worker
 *   does not turn it into a reply, the promise never settles — a hung demo,
 *   which is worse than a reported error. The worker always replies; this side
 *   always rejects on `ok: false`.
 * - **Abort that actually stops work.** This is the part that matters for this
 *   app. `latest-only.ts` coalesces the *waiting* input but lets the in-flight
 *   run finish, because on the main thread there was nothing to cancel. Across a
 *   worker there is: a superseded position's ~21 MB fetch is exactly the waste
 *   the prefetch discipline (DEC-R2-6) exists to avoid. So a cancelled call posts
 *   an `abort` naming the id it is dropping, and the worker honours it.
 * - **No leaks.** A pending entry is deleted on every settle path, including
 *   abort and disposal, so a long session does not accumulate dead resolvers.
 *
 * WHY IT TAKES A `Transport` RATHER THAN A `Worker`. All of the above is
 * ordinary bookkeeping that can be wrong in ordinary ways, and none of it needs
 * a real worker to test. `rpc-client.test.ts` drives it through an in-process
 * fake, so the only thing left needing a browser is that a worker is constructed
 * at all — which one e2e covers.
 *
 * @see rpc-client.ts.md

   * the demo wedges
   * in a state whose loading phase says error while its cycles think work is in
