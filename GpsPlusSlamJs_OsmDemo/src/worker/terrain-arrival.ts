/**
 * "Terrain just landed — is the mesh currently on screen now out of date?"
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (F1d, twelfth testing session). The terrain load and the
 * refresh run CONCURRENTLY, joined by `terrain-gate.ts` so the mesh is built on
 * the terrain of its own position. When the join times out, the mesh is built
 * on flat ground instead — and nothing ever rebuilt it, because the only thing
 * that triggers a rebuild is the NEXT `update`, and a terrain arrival does not
 * cause one. The owner saw buildings sitting at zero long after the relief had
 * loaded, and only a page reload fixed it.
 *
 * The damage was narrower than first reported and the distinction matters:
 * `terrainStamp` IS bumped when the field lands, and it is part of the mesh
 * planner's key, so the next refresh from ANY other cause — a category change,
 * a layer toggle, a geo-event, the next map click — rebuilds correctly. What
 * was missing is only the trigger from the arrival itself. On the ring the user
 * is actually looking at, nothing prompts that next refresh.
 *
 * WHY IT IS ITS OWN MODULE AND NOT A BRANCH IN `demo-worker.ts`. Same reason
 * `terrain-gate.ts` gives, and the same shape of question: this is a DECISION,
 * and a decision is what can be wrong. `demo-worker.ts` needs
 * `navigator.storage` and `OffscreenCanvas` to construct, so nothing written
 * inline there can be exercised by a unit test at all.
 *
 * WHY THE DECISION IS MADE IN THE WORKER RATHER THAN ON THE PAGE, which is
 * where the first draft of the plan put it. Two of the three inputs are worker
 * module state: `terrainStamp` and the record of what the standing mesh was
 * built from. Nothing in the terrain reply carried either, and inventing a page
 * copy of them would be a second source of truth for "what is the mesh standing
 * on" — the exact divergence `terrain-gate.ts` exists to prevent. The worker
 * decides; the page only acts.

   * while one is running ABORTS the run in flight and starts over. An ordinary
   * cold click posts the terrain load and the refresh together, and the
   * refresh's Overpass fetch takes 15–90 s — far longer than the terrain. So a
   * rebuild signalled on every arrival would cancel and re-issue that fetch on
   * every single click, turning a fix for a rare stall into a permanent
   * regression. It was caught in review, before it shipped.
   *
   * An update in flight is also, by construction, one that will build its mesh
   * against the field this arrival just installed — it is either still waiting
   * at the gate this arrival releases, or past it. So there is nothing to
   * signal: the rebuild is already happening.
