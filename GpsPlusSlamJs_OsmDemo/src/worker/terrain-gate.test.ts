/**
 * The terrain gate — W3's join, and the case that broke the design before it.
 *
 * Why these tests matter:
 * W3 unblocks the refresh from the DEM grid, which is worth seconds per click
 * and is only safe while something still guarantees the mesh is built on the
 * terrain of ITS OWN position. The first design guaranteed that by message
 * order; these tests exist because message order does not hold (DEC-R3-20) —
 * `loadTerrain` is `latestOnly`-wrapped and only queues while busy, so an
 * `update` can genuinely reach the worker first. The decisive test is
 * "waits for a centre that has not been requested yet".

   * The mechanism: `terrain-field.ts` uses the WINDOW-CENTRE height as its

   * terrain needed" and the mesh is built on the desktop field while the camera
   * is lifted to ellipsoidal height. On the second entry the AR field is
   * already held, which is why it looked fine.
