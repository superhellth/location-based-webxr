/**
 * "Do not build the mesh until the terrain under THIS position has landed."
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (W3, finding R3-3). The refresh used to be chained behind the
 * terrain load on the main thread — `loadTerrain(p).finally(() => refresh())` —
 * so an entire ~55 000-post DEM grid was sampled, transferred and applied before
 * the fetch and the scoring even started. Running them concurrently is worth
 * seconds per click, and it is only safe if something still guarantees that the
 * mesh is built on the terrain of the position it belongs to. Without that the
 * buildings stand on the PREVIOUS position's relief and nothing ever rebuilds
 * them — the half-swapped scene this demo has twice engineered away.
 *
 * WHY IT IS KEYED ON THE POSITION AND NOT ON MESSAGE ORDER (DEC-R3-20). The
 * first design said: `postMessage` delivery is ordered and the worker's listener
 * runs each handler synchronously, so posting `terrain` before `update`
 * guarantees the terrain is registered first. Both premises are true and the
 * conclusion is still false, because **`loadTerrain` does not always post when
 * it is called**: it is `latestOnly`-wrapped, so while a load is in flight a new
 * position only queues, and the post happens a microtask later. With the terrain
 * cycle busy and the refresh cycle idle — a slow DEM tile behind a fully cached
 * refresh, which is ordinary — the `update` is posted first and finds nothing
 * registered. Keying on the position makes the order irrelevant: the waiter
 * names the centre it needs and waits for that centre whenever it arrives.
 *
 * WHY THE WAIT IS BOUNDED TWICE. "Wait for a message that may never be posted"
 * is the failure mode this shape invites, and a hung worker is worse than a
 * stale field. It ends on the caller's own `AbortSignal` — a superseded click
 * aborts its update anyway — and on a timeout, after which the mesh is built on
 * whatever field is held. Degraded, never hung.
 *

/**
 * How long a mesh build waits for its terrain before giving up, milliseconds.
 *
 * A backstop, not a schedule. Every ordinary path settles the gate — the terrain
 * handler settles in a `finally`, so even a DEM outage releases waiters — so
 * reaching this means a load was dropped in a way nothing modelled. Long enough
 * to cover a real DEM fetch (tiles are ~21 MB of OSM's neighbour, but a
 * Terrarium tile is small and slow only on a cold network), short enough that a
 * user is not looking at a frozen scene.
 *
 * EXPORTED SINCE 2026-08-19, and the reason it was not is worth keeping. It
 * used to say: "nothing outside this module has any business branching on it,
 * and an export nobody imports is dead surface the dead-code gate is right to
 * reject." Both halves still hold — no caller branches on it, and callers that
 * need a different bound still pass `timeoutMs`.
 *
 * What changed is that this value became one end of a BUDGET. That relationship
 * has to be asserted somewhere, and asserting it against a copy of the number
 * would be a copy that can drift from this one — so the export exists to be
 * *read by a test*, not branched on.
 *
 * WHICH DEM NUMBER IT BOUNDS CHANGED ON 2026-08-19, and this comment said the
 * wrong one for a commit. Under `fallbackProvider` the sources were serial and
 * it was their SUM. Under the race they are concurrent and nothing waits for
 * the preferred one, so it is `PUBLISH_DEADLINE_MS` — the bound on the
 * composition — and neither per-source deadline. Asserting the old
 * relationship would now pass while the real publish path ran past this gate.

 * "a load began" signal to react to: it learns only that one finished. So a
 * re-sample at an unchanged centre (a retried DEM, a widened extent) releases
 * waiters on the OLD field's result.
 *
 * That is a real limitation rather than a bug to fix here, and the way to lift
 * it is already visible in the design: `keyOf` is the identity, so anything
 * that makes the second load a genuinely different field belongs IN the key.
 * `undulationM` is in there for precisely that reason. A change that makes two
 * different fields share one centre and one datum — the planned Mapterhorn
 * upgrade is exactly that — must add a third component, or the gate silently
 * stops being able to answer the question it exists for.
 *
 * `terrain-gate.test.ts` pins both halves: displacement by another centre, and
 * the same-centre pass-through. The second test is new, because the test that
 * appeared to cover it settled a different centre in the middle and so proved
