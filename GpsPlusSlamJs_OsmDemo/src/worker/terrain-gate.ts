/**
 * "Do not build the mesh until the terrain under THIS position has landed."
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (W3, finding R3-3). The refresh used to be chained behind the
 * terrain load on the main thread — `loadTerrain(p).finally(() => refresh())` —
 * so an entire ~55 000-post DEM grid was sampled, transferred and applied before
 * the fetch and the scoring even started. Running them concurrently is worth
 * seconds per click, and it is only safe if something still guarantees that the
 * mesh is built on the terrain of the position it belongs to. Without that the
 * buildings stand on the PREVIOUS position's relief and nothing ever rebuilds
 * them — the half-swapped scene this demo has twice engineered away.
 *
 * WHY IT IS KEYED ON THE POSITION AND NOT ON MESSAGE ORDER (DEC-R3-20). The
 * first design said: `postMessage` delivery is ordered and the worker's listener
 * runs each handler synchronously, so posting `terrain` before `update`
 * guarantees the terrain is registered first. Both premises are true and the
 * conclusion is still false, because **`loadTerrain` does not always post when
 * it is called**: it is `latestOnly`-wrapped, so while a load is in flight a new
 * position only queues, and the post happens a microtask later. With the terrain
 * cycle busy and the refresh cycle idle — a slow DEM tile behind a fully cached
 * refresh, which is ordinary — the `update` is posted first and finds nothing
 * registered. Keying on the position makes the order irrelevant: the waiter
 * names the centre it needs and waits for that centre whenever it arrives.
 *
 * WHY THE WAIT IS BOUNDED TWICE. "Wait for a message that may never be posted"
 * is the failure mode this shape invites, and a hung worker is worse than a
 * stale field. It ends on the caller's own `AbortSignal` — a superseded click
 * aborts its update anyway — and on a timeout, after which the mesh is built on
 * whatever field is held. Degraded, never hung.
 *

/**
 * How long a mesh build waits for its terrain before giving up, milliseconds.
 *
 * A backstop, not a schedule. Every ordinary path settles the gate — the terrain
 * handler settles in a `finally`, so even a DEM outage releases waiters — so
 * reaching this means a load was dropped in a way nothing modelled. Long enough
 * to cover a real DEM fetch (tiles are 28-68 MB of OSM's neighbour, but a
 * Terrarium tile is small and slow only on a cold network), short enough that a
 * user is not looking at a frozen scene.
 *
 * NOT EXPORTED: nothing outside this module has any business branching on it,
 * and an export nobody imports is dead surface the dead-code gate is right to
 * reject. Callers that need a different bound pass `timeoutMs`.
