/**
 * The demo's main-thread ↔ worker contract, as data.
 *
 * WHY A WORKER AT ALL. Everything expensive in this demo ran on the UI thread:
 * an Overpass response measured at ~21 MB of JSON to parse, a 19-chunk scoring
 * pass, a mesh build, and (since the terrain extent grew) ~55 000 DEM samples.
 * `gps-plus-slam-osm` was designed for this from the start — it documents itself
 * as worker-safe in six places, its public types are deliberately
 * structured-cloneable, and its mesh output is `Float32Array` specifically so it
 * can **transfer** rather than copy — but no consumer had ever exercised any of
 * it. This is the first one, so treat every claim here as newly tested rather
 * than long-established.
 *
 * WHY THE PROTOCOL IS ITS OWN MODULE. It is the one part of the boundary that is
 * pure data and can be checked without a worker, a browser or a GPU. The client
 * (`rpc-client.ts`) is tested against an in-process fake transport, and the
 * worker entry (`demo-worker.ts`) is the only file that needs a real one.
 *
 * WHAT MUST NOT BE PUT IN HERE. Anything non-cloneable: class instances,
 * functions, `Map`/`Set` of non-cloneable values, getters. A `Heightfield`
 * exposes a **method** (`heightAt`), so it cannot cross — the transferable form
 * carries the posts plus the geometry needed to rebuild the sampler on the other
 * side. Getting this wrong throws `DataCloneError` at runtime and never at
 * compile time, which is why `worker-round-trip.test.ts` exists.
 *
