/**
 * AR mode: the city, in place, through the camera.
 *
 * **WHAT THIS MILESTONE DOES AND DOES NOT DO.** It starts a WebXR session,
 * hands the already-built city to the framework's scene graph in the right
 * frame, subscribes the world group to the fusion's alignment, and prepares the
 * scene's environment.
 *
 * **The environment lives in `ar-scene-environment.ts`, not here** (M2). The
 * demo has a recorded history of a wrong `scene.environment` making every
 * `MeshStandardMaterial` fail to compile and silently not draw, so the rule
 * against setting one is stated and tested in one place rather than being an
 * absence in this file that nobody could point at.
 *
 * **THE CONTENT IS REPARENTED, NOT REBUILT.** `BuildingView` has already turned
 * ~21 MB of features into typed arrays and three.js objects; AR needs the same
 * objects under a different root. `SceneContent` moves the subtree whole and
 * applies the axis change (the demo's scene is X=East, Y=Up, Z=−North; the
 * framework's scene root is NUE), so entering and leaving AR costs no rebuild.
 *
 * **ENTRY IS GATED ON A FIRST GPS FIX**, and that is not a nicety. The origin is
 * the framework's `zero`, which is `null` until a fix lands, and DEC-R11-6
 * rejected re-anchoring on the first non-null `zero` — so entering early and
 * correcting later is not available. See `ar-origin.ts`.
 *
 * Structure follows `WayfindingHudDemo`'s `ar-mode.ts` (the framework's
 * reference consumer); the UX follows DEC-12 instead, which keeps the map.
 *
 * @see ar-mode.ts.md

  // reason it is needed — an entry from a ground-level 3D view meets exactly
