/**
 * `SceneContent` — the AR attachment seam, pinned before AR exists.
 *
 * Why this test matters: milestone 0 of the AR plan is "prove the seam without
 * AR", and the thing that has to be true is narrow and easy to break — **the
 * world content moves to a new parent AS ONE SUBTREE, carrying its children.**
 * AR mode reparents this under the framework's scene root, where the GPS-world
 * frame lives; anything a future edit attaches to `BuildingView`'s own scene
 * instead of to this root silently stays behind, and the symptom is content
 * missing in AR while every desktop test stays green.
 *
 * `BuildingView` itself cannot be unit-tested — it constructs a
 * `THREE.WebGLRenderer` — so the seam is extracted to where a test can reach
 * it rather than left as an untested option on a class the unit suite cannot
 * instantiate. That extraction IS the milestone.
 *

/**
 * THE AXIS MAPPING, which the first version of this module asserted was
 * unnecessary and was WRONG about.
 *
 * The demo's scene is X=East, Y=Up, Z=−North (`main.ts` round-trips a picked
 * point as `frame.toLatLng({ x: point.x, y: -point.z })`, and `protocol.ts`
 * calls the ENU→scene reflection "a real trap"). The framework's scene root is
 * the GPS-world frame in NUE — X=North, Y=Up, Z=East
 * (`ar-scene-hierarchy.ts`, and `gpsMath.ts` returns `[north, up, east]`).
 *
 * Those are not the same frame. Plan §2.2 says so in capitals — "AXIS MAPPING
 * IS REAL WORK AND MUST NOT BE ASSUMED" — and the milestone-0 commit
 * nevertheless documented the opposite in three places, which would have sent
 * M1 to render the city 90° off while telling the implementer not to look.
 *
 * These tests are the "stated, tested, derived once" §2.2 asks for.
