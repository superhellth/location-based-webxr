/**
 * WHY THESE TESTS MATTER (F56).
 *
 * The label is the ONLY feedback a user gets when the found event is outside
 * the viewport, which is the common case: an event tile is ~900 m across and
 * the demo opens at zoom 18. If the distance or the direction is wrong, the
 * user walks the wrong way and the feature is worse than silence.
 *
 * The arithmetic has more edge cases than it looks: a bearing computed by
 * subtracting longitudes breaks at the antimeridian, and a compass bucket
 * computed by a bare floor mislabels due north for half its arc. Both are
 * pinned below because both are easy to write wrong and impossible to see.
