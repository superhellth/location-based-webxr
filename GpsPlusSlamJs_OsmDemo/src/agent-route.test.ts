/**
 * The agent's route — the first end-to-end run of the navigation chain.
 *
 * Why these tests matter:
 * Every piece below this has been unit-tested in isolation, and the design's own
 * verification note warns about exactly that: **"a synthetic field fixture that
 * makes the thing under test constant"**. A wall test where the path would route
 * to the gate anyway proves nothing. So the fixture here is built to fail if the
 * blocking is removed — the direct line is short and clear, and the only way
 * around is a detour that the assertions measure.
 *
 * The headline case is the design's own: a wall between the agent and its
 * destination, with a gap at one end. The route must **go around**, and the
 * proof is that it is longer than the straight line and never crosses the wall.
