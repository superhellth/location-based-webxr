# `ar-building-material.ts`

## Purpose

The AR building look — **"Double-sided X-ray pulse"**, ported from the owner's
chosen shader-lab variant (2026-08-16). An interior-safe luminous shell: both
faces glow, brighter at grazing angles, with a slow breathing pulse offset per
building.

## Public API

- `AR_SHELL_PARAMS` — the owner's chosen values, with the shader lab's own
  defaults recorded beside each in the source. They differ, and the differences
  are visible.
- `createArBuildingMaterial(params?) → { material, setTime(seconds) }` —
  `params` overrides any of `AR_SHELL_PARAMS`.

## Invariants & assumptions

- **The three material flags ARE the effect, not styling.**
  - `DoubleSide` makes it _interior-safe_ — standing inside a building you see
    its back faces glow rather than looking through a hole. It also roughly
    doubles the fragments on the largest mesh in the scene.
  - `AdditiveBlending` is what makes it read as light rather than paint.
  - `depthWrite: false` stops overlapping shells occluding each other wrongly —
    and, **accepted by the owner**, means the route line, NPC agent and POI
    markers now show _through_ buildings.
  - `depthTest` stays **on**: shells are still hidden by anything that does write
    depth, including the terrain.
- **`forceSinglePass`.** With additive blending and no depth write there is
  nothing for three's default two-pass transparency to order, so the second pass
  is pure fragment cost on the scene's biggest mesh.
- **AR only.** Additive over the desktop view's sky gradient would wash out and
  would lose the depth ordering that view depends on. `ar-mode.ts` applies and
  restores it; `building-view.ts` holds it so a mid-session refetch cannot drop it.
- **It needs two vertex attributes** that only the buildings layer carries:
  `aHeight01` (position within the feature, driving the vertical phase) and
  `aFeatureRand` (per-building phase offset). Names must match
  `mesh-layers.ts`'s `setAttribute` calls exactly — a mismatch leaves the
  attribute undefined and the pulse frozen at phase 0. Pinned by a test.
- **`color` is declared explicitly** rather than via `vertexColors: true`: that
  flag only injects defines for three's own shader chunks, which this shader
  does not use.
- **`setTime` refuses a non-finite clock.** The frame loop hands `elapsed`,
  which is 0 after a reset by documented contract; a NaN would make `sin` NaN
  and blank every building at once.
- **`colourMix` defaults to 0.35** (owner decision): the palette's class
  distinctions stay legible in AR — which is what `feature-colours.test.ts`
  protects — while the scene still reads as cyan. **`colourMix: 0` reproduces
  the approved screenshot exactly.**

## ⚠️ The risk that cannot be checked from a desk

Additive blending **brightens** what is behind it. The variant was judged against
a procedural backdrop; over a real camera feed on a bright daylit street the glow
may wash out to near-invisible, and at night it may bloom. This needs a phone,
and it is the one risk that could invalidate the choice outright.

Fallbacks if fragment cost proves too high: `FrontSide` (losing the
interior-safe property) or a distance cutoff. The AR HUD already reports draw
calls, triangles and a rolling fps, which is the instrument for that measurement.

**A second desk-proof question, and it compounds with the one above:** this
material **bypasses the scene's tone mapping and sRGB encode**. three.js
substitutes `#include <tonemapping_fragment>` / `#include <colorspace_fragment>`
into shader source that asks for them and injects them into source that does
not; neither appears here, so `gl_FragColor` is written raw while
`ar-scene-environment.ts` grades everything else through ACES at exposure. The
authored HSL therefore renders darker and less saturated than picked, and the
shell's brightness relative to its neighbours is not the approved relationship.
Whether that IS the approved look depends on whether the shader lab previewed
graded — so "adding the chunks" could be the regression rather than the fix.

## Tests

`ar-building-material.test.ts` — the three flags, that every uniform the fragment
shader declares is supplied (derived from the shader source, so adding a uniform
without wiring it cannot pass), the two attribute declarations, the owner's
parameters against the lab defaults, the colour-mix escape hatch, and that a
non-finite clock is refused.
