# `ar-hud.ts`

## Purpose

The measurement readout's surface: the element, the cadence, and the two ways
both go wrong.

## Invariants & assumptions

- **It lives inside `#ar-root`**, for the reason [`ar-toast.ts`](ar-toast.ts.md)
  records: WebXR composites only the dom-overlay root's subtree over the camera
  feed, so a readout anywhere else is invisible for exactly the session it is
  measuring.
- **It is SAMPLED, not written per frame.** The values change every frame; the
  DOM does not need to. Writing `textContent` at display rate inside the XR
  frame callback puts layout on the critical path of the thing being measured —
  **the instrument would change the reading.** At `AR_HUD_SAMPLE_MS = 500` a
  60 fps session writes once per 30 frames.
  - The first sample is always accepted, because half a second of blank readout
    at session start is half a second spent wondering whether it works.
  - Identical text is not rewritten: `textContent` invalidates layout even when
    the string is unchanged, and most samples are unchanged in most fields.
- **Nothing measured means nothing attached.** `#ar-root` is `position: fixed;
inset: 0` and hidden only while `:empty`, so an always-attached readout keeps
  a full-viewport, click-eating layer over the whole page whenever AR is not
  running — a regression this demo has shipped once (`ar-mode.ts`). It attaches
  on the first non-empty sample and detaches when there is nothing to say.
- **`aria-hidden`, unlike the toast.** It changes twice a second forever;
  announcing that makes the page unusable with a screen reader, and these are a
  developer instrument rather than user-facing content.
- **The clock is a parameter of `sample`**, so the cadence is testable without
  fake timers and the caller can pass the XR frame's own `elapsed`.
- **`dispose()` can be followed by more samples.** It runs on both AR exits, and
  a HUD that could not restart would make the second session of a page silently
  instrument-free.

## Public API

- `AR_HUD_SAMPLE_MS` — 500.
- `createArHud(root): ArHud` — `root` must be the element passed to `initAR`.
- `ArHud` — `{ sample(measurements, nowMs), due(nowMs), dispose() }`.
  - **`due` exists so the caller can skip BUILDING the argument.** `sample` is
    cheap; assembling an `ArMeasurements` is not — an ENU transform, a bilinear
    terrain read and a great-circle distance — and the XR frame loop was paying
    all of it at display rate for a readout that accepts a value twice a second,
    discarding roughly 30 of every 31 (PR review of P4/P5, finding 7). It is a
    query on the SAME `lastWriteMs` that `sample` gates on, never a second copy
    of the interval: two cadences drift, which is why `sample` returns a boolean
    in the first place.
  - **`due` and `sample` can still legitimately disagree** — the expand toggle
    repaints outside the window — so the fps window still resets on what
    `sample` returned, not on what `due` said.

  Its home is `.ar-stack`, the top-of-screen column `ar-mode.ts` builds, and NOT
  `#ar-root` directly (G9, DEC-W5): the overlay root also holds the framework's
  full-screen canvas, and making that element a flex column pushed the readout a
  whole viewport below the fold.

## Examples

```ts
const hud = createArHud(container);

// `elapsed` is PAGE-relative, so the window has to be opened from the first
// frame's value rather than from zero — see `frame-loop.ts.md`.
let windowOpenedAtS: number | undefined;
let framesThisWindow = 0;

registerXrFrameUpdate(({ elapsed }) => {
  windowOpenedAtS ??= elapsed;
  framesThisWindow += 1;
  const windowS = elapsed - windowOpenedAtS;

  // `sample` returns whether it ACCEPTED the sample. Discarding that is what
  // makes an averaged fps impossible: the caller cannot know when to reset its
  // counters, so it either never resets or resets on frames the HUD ignored.
  const wrote = hud.sample(
    { fps: windowS > 0 ? framesThisWindow / windowS : undefined, ...live },
    elapsed * 1000,
  );
  if (wrote === true) {
    framesThisWindow = 0;
    windowOpenedAtS = elapsed;
  }
});
```

**This example used to read `fps: dt > 0 ? 1 / dt : undefined` and drop
`sample`'s return value** — a single-frame reciprocal, which is the thing this
module's own invariant list says it is not. On a phone that flickers between
plausible and alarming with no way to tell a sustained drop from a hiccup, which
is the only question the number exists to answer.

## Tests

`ar-hud.test.ts` — writes into the root; stays OUT of it while empty; leaves it
empty again when the numbers go; ignores a sample inside the window and takes
the next one after it; accepts the FIRST sample immediately; is `aria-hidden`;
and disposes without becoming unusable.

## Collapse and expand (DEC-H2)

One collapsible readout rather than two tiers. Collapsed is what you walk with;
expanded is what you open just before taking a screenshot. Membership lives in
`ar-measurements.ts`; this file owns the surface and the state.

- **The preference persists** in `localStorage` under `osm-demo:ar-hud-expanded`.
  Without that it is re-enabled by hand on every field trip, which is the
  friction that gets an instrument abandoned.
  - Both reads and writes are wrapped in `try`/`catch`: `localStorage`
    **throws** on access in private mode and in sandboxed iframes rather than
    being merely empty. Losing the preference is acceptable; losing the readout
    the session is being measured with is not. Pinned by a test.
- **The toggle repaints immediately**, not at the next 500 ms sample. A control
  that waits that long reads as broken, so the user presses it again and toggles
  straight back. The last sample is held for exactly this.
- **The numbers are `aria-hidden`, the toggle is not.** The attribute moved from
  `.ar-hud` to `.ar-hud-values` when the toggle arrived: an `aria-hidden`
  subtree containing a focusable button is the worst of both, still reachable by
  keyboard and invisible to the screen reader that would describe it.
- ⚠️ **`.ar-hud` sets `pointer-events: none`** so the readout can never eat a tap
  on a full-viewport overlay — so `.ar-hud-toggle` must **opt back in** with
  `pointer-events: auto`. Without that rule the button is inert on a real device
  while every jsdom test still passes, because jsdom does no hit-testing. The
  CSS lives in `index.html` beside the other AR overlay classes.
  - Class names are **kebab-case, not BEM**: the gate's `lint:css` enforces
    `selector-class-pattern`, and `__` names fail it.
