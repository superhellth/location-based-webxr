/**
 * `composeClickTimings` — the invariants that must hold for ANY inputs.
 *
 * Why this test matters: this module's prose makes four absolute claims —
 * the stages plus the residual equal the wall clock exactly, no stage is
 * negative, every share is a fraction of the whole, and no stage is altered on
 * its way through. All four were written in comments and enforced by
 * example-based tests over one hand-tuned fixture, which is the configuration
 * where an arithmetic edge (a zero wall clock, an over-reporting worker, a
 * stage larger than the whole) is least likely to be tried.
 *
 * The library half of this same work shipped `tile-timings.property.test.ts`
 * and it earned its keep on the first run by producing `transportMs: -1`
 * against a design whose entire justification was avoiding that. The same rule
 * applies here, and this is the more arithmetic of the two modules.
 *
