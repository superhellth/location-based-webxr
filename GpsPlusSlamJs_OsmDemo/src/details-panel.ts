/**
 * The details panel: why THIS cell scores what it scores.
 *
 * WHY A PANEL RATHER THAN A BIGGER POPUP. The popup is small, it sits on top of
 * the thing being inspected, and on a phone it covers most of the map. A tree
 * over "every contributing element and every one of its tags" is the wrong
 * shape for it. The panel is also where a 3D pick lands once that exists, so
 * one selection has one place to be explained regardless of which view produced
 * it.
 *
 * WHY IT IS AN OVERLAY ON DESKTOP TOO (DEC-17). The plan first put it in a thin
 * third column. On a laptop that leaves the 2D and 3D panes at ~450 px each —
 * the width that made the 3D pane useless on the phone. Floating it over the
 * split keeps both views full size, costs a dismiss button, and means one
 * layout to build and test instead of two.
 *
 * Every decision it renders lives in `explanation-tree.ts`; this file builds
 * nodes. Text goes in with `textContent`, never a template string: tag keys and
 * values come from OSM and the rule ids from a publicly editable sheet, and
 * avoiding the HTML sink is stronger than escaping into one.
 *
 * @see details-panel.ts.md
