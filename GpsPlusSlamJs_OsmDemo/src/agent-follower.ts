/**
 * The agent as a body with mass, following the path (DEC-R13-3 … DEC-R13-5,
 * DEC-R13-14).
 *
 * WHAT THE SESSION ASKED FOR. The drawn route is exact and should stay exact —
 * "den exakten Pfad ... finde ich sehr gut" — but the figure sliding exactly
 * along it makes every hex vertex a hard direction change. The path should be a
 * REFERENCE curve, with the movement led smoothly along an averaged one,
 * "vielleicht sogar mit so einem typischen, physikbasierten, inertiabasierten
 * Lerping ... da hat er dann quasi so eine Masse und eine Geschwindigkeit". That
 * is what this is: the path position is a moving target and the agent
 * accelerates towards it, so the zigzag lives in the drawn line and not in the
 * motion.
 *
 * **THE PATH IS NOT SMOOTHED, THE AGENT IS** (DEC-R13-3). Drawing the smoothed
 * curve instead would look finished and destroy the view of what the planner
 * actually chose — which is the thing the session was trying to diagnose.
 *
 * **CRITICALLY DAMPED, NOT CLAMPED** (DEC-R13-5). The alternative was to clamp
 * the smoothed position back inside the routed cells, which guarantees the
 * invariant by construction and shows as the agent hugging a wall at a tight
 * corner. Tuning carries the invariant instead, so the invariant is written as a
 * property test rather than as a comment — see `agent-follower.property.test.ts`.
 *
 * **AND THE PROPERTY IS BOUNDED AT THE SHIPPED SPEED** (DEC-R13-14). Critical
 * damping bounds overshoot past a STATIONARY target; it does not bound
 * corner-cutting against a MOVING one. A lagging follower always cuts the inside
 * of a corner, and the cut grows without bound with speed — so "at any speed"
 * would be false by construction rather than untuned.
 *
 * @see agent-follower.ts.md

/**
 * Roughly how long the agent takes to close a gap to its target, in seconds.
 *
 * THE TUNABLE, and it trades two visible things against each other. Larger is
 * smoother and lags further behind the path; smaller tracks the polyline more
 * exactly and puts the zigzag back into the motion. It also sets the corner cut,
 * which at the demo's 10 m/s is what {@link FOLLOWER_MAX_DEVIATION_M} has to
 * cover — so raising it means re-running the corridor property, not just
 * watching the demo.
 *
 * 0.25 s is a quarter of a second of "body", which at `AGENT_SPEED_MPS` is
 * ~2.5 m of lag: enough to rounds off a 60° hex vertex, comfortably inside a
 * res-13 cell's 3.54 m inradius.

 * planner actually cleared. So this is "the corridor the route was planned
 * through", expressed as a distance a test can evaluate — the route is a list of
 * points, and nothing in the codebase had a corridor object to assert against.

 * The margin is deliberately not padded: the property is meant to fail if the
 * follower would clip a wall, and a generous bound is a property that cannot.

 * when `dt` is large — which is exactly what a backgrounded tab hands back on
 * its first frame — and would make the corridor property pass at 60 Hz and fail
 * at 20. Here a large `dt` simply arrives: the exponential term goes to zero and
 * the position lands on the target, which is the right answer for "the tab was
 * hidden for two seconds".
 *
 * **A NON-ADVANCING CLOCK RETURNS THE FOLLOWER UNCHANGED.** `dt <= 0` is real —
