# `agent-route.ts` — pass A and pass B, joined

## Purpose

Plans a walkable route between two positions. This is the first place the whole
navigation chain runs end to end — obstacle index, column model, injected ground,
state search — against a real feature set rather than a synthetic field.

DEC-R11-3 fixes what it is for: the agent is ordered by click and **the planned
route is always drawn**, because seeing the route go _around_ the wall is the
proof, and a polyline is a far better test artefact than watching a marker move.

## Public API

- `planRoute(features, from, to, options) => RoutePoint[] | undefined` — the
  one-shot form; builds an index per call, so it is what the unit tests drive.
- `planRouteWithIndex(index, from, to, options) => RoutePoint[] | undefined` —
  the production form, exported since stage 4 landed its caller. That caller is
  the worker's `planRoute` handler, which holds one index per feature set
  (`worker/obstacle-index-cache.ts`) and answers many clicks from it.
- `RoutePoint` — `{ position: LatLng, heightM: number }`.
- `RouteOptions` — `{ frame, field, maxExpansions?, scoreFor? }`.
- `DEFAULT_ROUTE_EXPANSIONS` = 20 000, module-private (an export nothing
  imports is dead code the gate rejects; it becomes one if a caller ever needs
  to override it by name).

**`undefined` means "the agent is not going there"** and covers both no-route and
cap-reached. `findCheapestPath` throws on the cap, deliberately, so a caller
cannot mistake "gave up" for "nowhere to go" — this boundary absorbs that throw,
because a UI has nothing to do with the distinction and every reason not to crash
on a long click. It absorbs **`RangeError` only**: the search documents that as
its sole throw, so anything else is a fault here or in the inputs and stays loud.
A bare `catch` cost real time during stage 1, reporting an un-rebuilt library as
"no route".

## The cost model (DEC-R13-1, DEC-R13-11 … DEC-R13-13)

The search is **A\* over metres with a score penalty**, not breadth-first. The
ninth session reported two things — "he does not take the shortest way" and "he
does not prefer the paths" — and one line explained both: BFS costs every
`gridDisk` neighbour 1 whatever direction it lies in, so a straight run and a
staircase tie and sort order picks the winner.

```
cost(from, to) = metres(from, to) × penaltyFor(scoreFor?.(to.cell))
heuristic(s)   = metres(s, goal)
```

- **The metres alone fix the zigzag**, with no score involved.
- **`penaltyFor` is `route-penalty.ts`'s**, and the category, the neutral value
  and the reference scale are all argued there.
- **The heuristic is unpenalised**, which is what keeps it a lower bound —
  `penaltyFor` never returns less than 1, so no route can be cheaper than its own
  metres. `search.ts` explains why consistency rather than mere admissibility is
  the contract.
- **`scoreFor` is injected, not looked up.** The scores live in the pipeline
  inside the worker, and this module must stay constructible from a feature list
  alone. The worker's `planRoute` handler already holds that pipeline — the same
  one `explain` reads — so **no new payload crosses the worker boundary**.
- **Omitting `scoreFor` is plain distance**, because a uniform multiplier cannot
  change which route is cheapest. That is the honest default for a caller with no
  scores, and what the unit fixtures rely on.
- **Climb is not charged.** Cost is horizontal metres; including the climb would
  make the agent avoid stairs and slopes, which nobody asked for. The drawn
  polyline still measures its own length with the climb included
  (`route-path.ts`) — a different question: how far the agent walks, not what the
  planner minimised.
- **Cell centres are memoised per route.** A\* prices up to six neighbours and one
  heuristic per expansion, so an uncached `cellToLatLng` would run tens of
  thousands of times for a few hundred distinct cells. The cache lives for one
  route, so it cannot go stale against a re-anchor.
- **A\* costs ~28 % more than the BFS on the UNREACHABLE case, and that is the
  worst case rather than the typical one.** Profiled on the sealed-courtyard
  fixture, where no route exists so the whole reachable set is expanded and the
  heuristic has nothing to prune: 526 ms → 671 ms, with `canCross` going
  20 531 → 31 254 calls. A weighted search must ask legality per improving
  offer, where breadth-first could ask once per discovered state. The
  `DEFAULT_ROUTE_EXPANSIONS` cap is unchanged; the timing assertion in
  `agent-route.test.ts` was raised from 2 000 ms to 3 000 ms to match, with the
  numbers recorded there.
  - Where a route DOES exist the heuristic prunes and A\* is competitive or
    better, which is why this is stated as a bound on the pathological case
    rather than as a general slowdown.

## Invariants & assumptions

- **Positions out, not cells.** A consumer re-deriving lat/lng from H3 indices
  would be re-deciding `cellToLatLng` — the "two computations that agree today
  with nothing asserting they always will" shape this demo keeps finding.
- **A route is bounded work or it is a freeze.** The library default cap is
  100 000, sized for a scored working set rather than for a click. The case that
  matters is an UNREACHABLE destination: "no route" is only knowable once the
  frontier is empty, so a mis-click across a wall makes the search exhaust
  everything reachable first. Found by a test timing out at 5 s under suite
  load — the test was reporting a real freeze on the demo click path, not being
  slow. 20 000 covers ~500 m of open ground at two levels per cell.
- **The index is the expensive part**, which is why `planRouteWithIndex` exists.
  `buildObstacleIndex` runs `coverCells` at res-13 over every barrier and
  building in the working set; rebuilding it per click would put a publish-sized
  cost on an interaction. Keep one index per published feature set.
- **The agent starts at the LOWEST standable level** in its cell — the ground it
  is on. Starting from the highest would put it on a wall top it cannot have
  climbed to; there is no ingress this round (DEC-R11-10).
- **`canCross` is what makes the route go around.** Without it the search steps
  through walls. Mutation-checked: replacing it with `() => true` fails three
  tests.
  - **The cost model is a new reason to PREFER a cell, never a new reason to
    ENTER one.** A tempting score on the far side of a wall changes nothing;
    `crossesObstacle` remains the sole authority on what blocks, and a test pins
    it at the maximum score.
- An unknown ground height (`NaN`) makes the start cell unstandable, so no route
  is planned. Better than planning from a position that does not exist.

## Examples

```ts
const index = buildObstacleIndex(publishedFeatures);
const route = planRouteWithIndex(index, agentPosition, clickedPosition, {
  frame,
  field: fieldFor(terrain),
});
if (route !== undefined) drawPolyline(route);
```

## Tests

`agent-route.test.ts`:

- **The control** — with no obstacles the route is near-straight. Without it the
  wall test cannot tell "routed around the wall" from "routes the long way round
  everywhere", which is the exact fixture trap the plan's §4 names.
- **Goes around a wall**, and **north of the wall's end where the gap is** —
  the second is stronger than the first, because a longer route wandering south
  would pass a length assertion while proving nothing about the gap.
- Sealed destination → `undefined`; cap reached → `undefined`, not a throw.
- Heights come from the injected sampler, so the polyline sits on the ground.
- Unknown ground → no route.

`agent-route.slope.test.ts` — **the guard for a defect every other route test
was blind to.** All of the above run on ground of a CONSTANT height — mostly
`field: undefined`, which `cell-ground.ts` turns into a flat zero, and otherwise
a sampler returning one number — so `Δground` is 0 in every one of them, and
nothing here could see that `columnsAdjacent` was comparing DEM samples ~6.5 m
apart against a 0.5 m step limit and refusing every ground steeper than ~7.5 %. A live session reported the Cologne Frankenwerft promenade as
unreachable in every downhill direction. This file routes over a plane at the
measured 24 % grade — down and up — and keeps two controls: a 150 % cliff is
still refused, and a sealed wall on that same slope still is too.

`agent-route.test.ts` › "planRoute, weighted by the walkable score" covers the
cost model, and pins the two halves separately because either can be fixed alone
and look half-right on screen:

- **near-straight on open ground** — measured between the route's OWN endpoints
  so cell-centre quantisation is not folded into the ratio, and bounded by the
  lattice's own floor: a hex grid has no due-east neighbour, so even a perfect
  line costs `1 / cos(30°) = 1.155`. 1.17 leaves room for one cell of rounding
  and nothing else.
- **detours onto a lane of high-scoring cells**, and actually reaches it rather
  than merely leaning towards it.
- **ignores a lane whose detour costs more than it saves** — the pair is what
  pins the trade-off; an NPC chasing any path at any distance is as wrong as one
  ignoring them.
- **does not route around the scored area** to reach cheaper unknown ground,
  which is DEC-R13-12 expressed as a route rather than as a number.
- **still goes around a wall at the maximum score**.
- **plans a long route inside the default expansion cap** — the guard on the
  interaction between `PATH_PREFERENCE` and `DEFAULT_ROUTE_EXPANSIONS`.

**Where it runs.** In the WORKER, behind the `planRoute` call — `ObstacleIndex`
holds a method and `Map`s, so it cannot be structured-cloned and the route has to
be computed on the side that holds the index (DEC-R11-16). The search is
synchronous, so it also delays the next publish; that is what makes the expansion
cap a publish-latency bound as well as a freeze bound, and why an `abort` cannot
preempt a route in flight.

## `RouteOptions.onPathAt` — path-ness (DEC-R2)

`(cell) => boolean | undefined`. Whether a cell carries a pedestrian way.
Injected for the same reason `scoreFor` is: the answer lives in the pipeline
inside the worker, and this module stays constructible from a feature list alone.
No new payload crosses the worker boundary — the handler reads the same
provenance and feature maps `explain` already walks.

- Cost is now `metres × penaltyFor(score) × pathFactor(onPath)`. **Both factors
  are `>= 1`**, which is what keeps the unpenalised heuristic a lower bound.
- **Memoised per route** (`memoisePathness`), like `cellMetres` and for the same
  reason — it is consulted once per expanded cell, up to `maxExpansions` times,
  and the lookup behind it walks two maps per call. The memo uses `cache.has`
  rather than a truthiness test, because `undefined` is a legitimate and common
  answer outside the scored disk.
- Omitted, or uniformly `undefined`, leaves the route exactly where plain
  distance puts it. `agent-route.test.ts` asserts that equivalence directly.

Covered by "path-ness steers the route (DEC-R2)" in `agent-route.test.ts`: the
route detours onto a near corridor, ignores one too far to be worth it, and is
unchanged when nothing is known. The first of those was verified to go red when
the multiplier is disabled — a green outcome test that cannot fail is the
failure mode this suite has already met once.
