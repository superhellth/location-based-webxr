/**
 * The physical sun: a time of day, an elevation, an azimuth, a direction.
 *
 * WHY THESE TESTS MATTER. This module REVERSES DEC-R4-6, under which the sun's
 * azimuth followed the camera so a specular highlight was never lost as the eye
 * orbited. That was the right answer for a painted sky and the wrong one for a
 * scattering shader, because a sun that tracks the camera makes the whole sky
 * spin as you pan — which reads as a bug rather than as lighting (DEC-R6-3).
 *
 * The arithmetic here is the part that can be wrong in a way you would only
 * notice by looking: a sun that rises in the west, an azimuth that jumps by 2π
 * mid-sweep, a direction vector that is not unit length so the `DirectionalLight`
 * and the sky shader disagree about where the sun is. None of that throws, and
 * a GPU cannot be asked about it in CI — so it is proved here, in JS, exactly as
 * `sampleTerrainTexture` is proved against `heightAt`.
 *
 * The compass convention is asserted rather than assumed, because it is the one
 * thing a reader cannot recover from the code: azimuth is measured CLOCKWISE
 * FROM NORTH, and north is the render frame's −z.
