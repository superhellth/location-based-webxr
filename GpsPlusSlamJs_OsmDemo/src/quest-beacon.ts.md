# `quest-beacon.ts`

## Purpose

The 3D quest markers — milestone **N6** (DEC-U14), scoped by **DEC-K4**. A large
gold exclamation mark floating above each quest, with a thin bright line down to
the ground it marks.

The design is the field report's own:

> "so ein gelbes 3D-Ausrufezeichen … das irgendwie einfach schön groß ist, dass
> man es auch von ein bisschen weiter weg sehen kann … und so eine dünne Linie
> nach unten hat und dann quasi im Boden im Endeffekt endet"

Built from primitives rather than loaded: it has to be legible at several hundred
metres and cost nothing to fetch.

## Public API

- `createQuestBeacons(): QuestBeacons` — `{ root, set(placements), dispose() }`.
  `set` replaces every beacon; an empty list clears them.
  - **`dispose()` is called by `BuildingView.dispose()`**, and by nothing else:
    the beacons hang off the view's content root, so the scene-level teardown
    never reaches them, and the geometries and material would leak GPU-side
    without that call. The call and its ordering are pinned by
    `building-view-content.test.ts` (PR #342 review).
- `questBeaconMaterials()` — the materials, exported so
  `ar-content-materials.test.ts` can check them **by name** rather than absorb
  them into a count.

## Invariants & assumptions

- **On the AR content root, never the scene** (`BuildingView.setQuestBeacons`).
  Objects added straight to the scene are left behind when AR starts, and a quest
  you can see on the desktop but not while walking to it is the wrong half of the
  feature. `attachTo` applies `DEMO_TO_NUE` and the ENU offset to the whole
  subtree, so placements stay in demo coordinates and need **no per-object
  conversion**.
  - Pinned by the **positive** half of `building-view-content.test.ts`. The
    negative half matches only `this.scene.add(...)`, so it would not notice a
    beacon at all — the guard with teeth here is the inclusion list.
- **The line is sized from THIS beacon's drop**, `y - groundY`, not from
  `QUEST_BEACON_HOVER_M`. The two are equal only where the ground is flat, which
  is nowhere that matters; sizing from the constant leaves the line ending in
  mid-air over sloped terrain, pointing at nothing.
  - ⚠️ The first version of that test used a drop that happened to **equal** the
    hover constant, so it passed against an implementation that used the
    constant. The numbers now differ deliberately.
- **No line at all when the drop is zero.** A zero-length cylinder renders as a
  disc-shaped artefact, which reads as a rendering fault.
- **Diffuse, emissive, and fogged** — the three ways this object could exist and
  be invisible:
  - `metalness = 1` zeroes the diffuse term, and AR gives the scene nothing to
    reflect, so the marker draws **black**. `ar-content-materials.test.ts` exists
    because that has happened.
  - `fog: false` makes it refuse to fade and then **clip at the far plane**
    instead — the "prototype" preset's failure, on the one object whose job is to
    be seen from far away.
  - So the glow comes from `emissive`, which is neither.
- ⚠️ **There is deliberately NO `frustumCulled = false`, and this bullet used
  to claim the opposite.** It said the root must not be culled because a stale
  group bounding sphere would hide the marker. three.js cannot produce that
  failure: `projectObject` reads the flag only inside its `isSprite` and
  `isMesh || isLine || isPoints` branches, so on a `Group` it does nothing at
  all. The child meshes are culled individually against their own static
  geometries, which is correct. Caught by the PR #342 review.
- **Rebuilt wholesale on each `set`**, not diffed: a search returns at most seven
  picks and replaces all of them at once, so a diff would be more code guarding a
  case that does not arise.

## Known limits

### ~~A quest search moves the MAP but not the 3D CAMERA~~ — FIXED 2026-08-23

It did, and it made the beacon useless at the moment it was wanted: the winner
landed ~370 m out in the demo's own fixture and sat outside the frustum.

`main.ts`'s `onFound` now calls `BuildingView.lookAtFrom` alongside the map's
`panTo`. **`lookAtFrom` keeps the current direction and distance** — the
operator's zoom and angle are theirs, and a search should move _where_ they are
looking, not _how_. It is on the SEARCH rather than on the store subscriber
that draws the beacons, so clearing a quest does not fling the view anywhere.

Measured: the clear-the-quest frame diff went **0 → 110 → 286** differing
pixels — 0 while the camera stayed put, 110 once it followed, 286 after the
mark was enlarged. Mutation-verified: removing the `lookAtFrom` call returns it
to 0.

### Terrain updates do not re-place existing beacons

Beacons are not re-placed when the terrain window loads or moves. A quest
found during a DEM outage keeps relief 0 until the next search. It is visible and
correctly positioned horizontally; only its height and the length of its line are
stale. Re-placing on every terrain apply would need the held event threaded into
that path, which is more coupling than the case earns today.

## Tests

- `quest-beacon.test.ts` — one group per placement, wholesale replacement,
  position, the line reaching the ground, no line at zero drop, the material's
  three invisibility modes, and dispose.
  - **Mutation-verified**: sizing the line from the hover constant instead of the
    beacon's own drop fails two tests.
- `scene-3d.spec.js` → "draws a quest beacon in the 3D view, and takes it down
  again". **This could not exist until the camera followed the search.** The
  first attempt measured the map-driven camera move rather than the beacon, and
  reported nothing when the quest was cleared because the marker had never been
  visible; it was deleted rather than tuned.
  - **The CLEAR is the assertion that carries the weight**: searching moves the
    camera, so that frame changes either way, while clearing moves nothing but
    the marker.
  - The floor is 100 differing pixels against a measured 286 — loose on purpose,
    so a restyle fails for being wrong rather than for being different.
- `ar-content-materials.test.ts` — the beacon's material is in the AR set by
  name, and the count now includes it.
- `building-view-content.test.ts` — the beacon root is on the content root.
