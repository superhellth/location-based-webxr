/**
 * The legend, in the DOM.
 *
 * Thin on purpose: every decision — which bands exist, what they say, that no
 * two of them look alike — lives in `legend-model.ts` and is tested without a
 * browser. This file turns that model into elements and nothing else.
 *
 * WHY IT IS BUILT WITH `textContent` AND NOT A TEMPLATE STRING. The category
 * name is a column header from the publicly editable rule sheet, and so is
 * anything derived from it. The framework’s `escape-html.ts` exists because this app already
 * renders sheet-derived text into HTML sinks; the legend avoids the sink
 * entirely rather than escaping its way through one.
 *
 * @see legend-view.ts.md
