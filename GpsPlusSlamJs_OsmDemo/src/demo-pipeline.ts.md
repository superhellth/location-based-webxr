# `src/demo-pipeline.ts`

## Purpose

Fetch → `AffordanceIndex` → scored cells and regions. The demo's whole data
path, with no DOM in it.

## Public API

- `class DemoPipeline` — `update(position, category, signal?): Promise<DemoSnapshot>` (the signal is checked PER TILE, which is where the saving is: a tile is ~21 MB), `scoreFor(cell): CellScore | undefined` (so `explainCell` can be answered inside the worker, where the merged features already are),
  `features()`, static `chunkFor(position)`
  - `geoEvent(position, category, now, signal?, options?)` →
    `{ event, stats }`. `options.overlapMinutes` is the C#'s handover window;
    omit it for the production default and pass `0` for an explicitly picked
    time, which is a request for THAT slot rather than a statement about
    arriving (see `nextEventTime`).
  - **`stats` is `GeoEventStats` (W7), and it is only measurable here**: the
    counters live on the index and the phase timings on this method, both
    private inside the worker.
    - **The pinning numbers are taken per search, not read off the index.**
      `chunksPinnedPeak` comes from inside the `withPinned` callback, where the
      live count is this search's; the index's own peak is a session maximum
      that never resets. `pinnedOverCap` is that count against
      `index.maxRetainedChunks`, because the index's field is set only by
      `evictBeyond` — which never runs while a search's pins are held. `climbsStarted` is counted through a wrapper
      handed only to the algorithm — step 1 calls the same `toCell` while deriving
      the reach, and counting there would report ensure-set arithmetic as climbing
      work.
  - **A neighbouring event tile is admitted only when its whole REACH is
    already loaded, not when its centre is.** This was the centre for several
    rounds, which broke the promise the method's own docstring makes — that a
    neighbour whose data is missing is skipped, because loading one costs
    ~15–90 s. The ensure set built for an admitted neighbour extends
    `CLIMB_STEPS + 1` cells past each of its candidates, and its candidates are
    seeded across its whole bounding box: ~550 m past the centre, into fetch
    tiles nothing had checked. Measured at the demo's Manhattan default as six
    of seven neighbours admitted and three tiles downloaded;
    `geo-event-reach.test.ts` has the geometry and
    `demo-pipeline.test.ts` the end-to-end rule.
    - **The centre tile stays exempt**: the user is standing in it, so it is
      searched whatever it costs. Its own reach can overhang what a refresh
      loaded (one tile at Manhattan), which is a separate open question.
    - **DEC-R9-4 is untouched.** Every tile's event is still a pure function of
      (tile, time); only WHICH tiles are visible changes, which is exactly what
      DEC-R9-15 already accepted — "a device that has loaded more discovers more
      of them, and they converge".
- `interface DemoPipelineOptions` — `source`, `table`, `categories?`,
  `monotonicNow?`, `maxChunks?`
  - `maxChunks` is **forwarded** to `AffordanceIndexOptions.maxChunks`, which has
    always been public; this wrapper simply never passed it on. Omitted means the
    index's default of 488 (`CHUNKS_PER_WORKING_SET × WORKING_SETS_RETAINED`).
  - **The cap is what bounds stage 5.** 488 chunks × 49 res-13 children = 23 912
    cells is the hard ceiling on `scoresByCell`, and therefore on every derive
    pass, however far the user walks. `derive-growth.test.ts` measures the
    approach to it and asserts the plateau; its header carries the recorded 3 km
    table and the ~1.1 s-per-refresh derive cost at the cap.
- `interface DemoSnapshot` — `cells`, `regions`, `threshold`, `missingTiles`,
  `loadedTiles`, `stats`, `radius`
  - `radius` is which ring of the progressive widening this snapshot describes,
    normalised from `update`'s optional `radius` argument in ONE place so the
    snapshot cannot claim a ring the fetch loop never covered. Compare it against
    `SCORE_DISK_MAX_RADIUS` — or better, against `isFinalRing` in
    `refresh-cycle.ts`, which lives next to the list that defines "last" — to ask
    whether more snapshots are coming. See `refresh-cycle.ts.md`.
  - `loadedTiles` are the res-7 tiles currently held, surfaced so the map can
    DRAW the downloaded extent. "One res-7 tile" stays an abstraction until it
    is a box over a city — and the query covers the tile's bounding box, not the
    hexagon, which is a 1.39× difference worth seeing rather than being told.
    See `fetch-extent.ts.md`.

## Invariants & assumptions

- **`update` checks its `AbortSignal` TWICE, and both are load-bearing.** Once per
  tile in the fetch loop, and once again after the loop before scoring.
  - The per-tile check is where the bytes are: a tile is ~21 MB.
  - The post-loop check exists because the per-tile one only fires when there IS a
    next tile, and at an interior position the working set needs exactly one. A run
    superseded during its single fetch would otherwise go on to score 19 chunks and
    931 cells for a position the user had already left. **A test found this** — see
    `demo-pipeline.test.ts`.
  - The signal is deliberately NOT threaded into `fetchTile`, which would need an
    `AbortSignal` through `OsmDataSource`, `CachingSource` and `OverpassSource` — a
    package API change and its own piece of work. The request already in flight
    completes; only the ones after it are skipped.

- **DOM-free and unit-tested, because the browser is a bad debugger.** Iteration
  8's value is a human judging a picture; getting the data to the picture is
  ordinary wiring that fails in ordinary ways, and separating the two is what
  makes "is the data wrong or the drawing wrong?" answerable.
- **This is the first real consumer of `AffordanceIndex`** — which is why the
  lifecycle layer was built before this iteration rather than during it.
- **Fetch failures are COLLECTED, not thrown.** A demo that dies because one of
  three tiles was rate-limited hides the two that arrived, and "some of the map
  is missing" is precisely the state the fetch policy degrades into by design.
  `missingTiles` is surfaced so the UI can say so.
- **Tiles already handed to the index are not refetched** on a redraw.
- **Still no store and no event emitter INSIDE this class**, though the reason
  has narrowed. The original claim was that the demo needed no shared-state
  layer at all — right for two write-only views and one input. Round-1 feedback
  added a legend, a details panel and a selected cell three views must agree on,
  so a Redux store now exists in `osm-store.ts` — but it sits **above** this
  file. This class stays a pure data producer: position and category in, a
  `DemoSnapshot` out, no subscriptions and no dispatch. That is what keeps "is
  the data wrong or the drawing wrong?" answerable by testing it in isolation.

- **`chunkFor` computes the chunk the SAME way `update()` does** —
  `latLngToCell(…, SCORE_CHUNK_RES)`, never `toScoreChunk` of a res-13 cell.
  The two are different functions: `toScoreChunk` walks the H3 **index**
  hierarchy, and H3 children are not geometrically contained by their parents.
  Four of sixty positions on a Cologne sweep disagreed, so a label built the
  index way names a different chunk than the one that was scored — and making
  the chunk grid legible is this view's entire job.

## The cell array is optional (round 10, stage B)

`update`'s fifth argument takes `{ includeCells }`, defaulting to `true`.

**Why it exists.** The array structured-clones across the worker boundary in a
measured 27–35 ms at the 488-chunk cap, three times per move — and in the
**default configuration the page draws none of it**. The `cells` layer is off
(DEC-R7b-5/R7b-6, because the map would draw one Leaflet polygon per cell), the
regions are computed here, and the only other thing the page did with the array
was derive `heatScale`'s `max`. So ~24 000 cells travelled to produce one number.

The snapshot now reports `observedMax`, `aboveThresholdCount` and `cellCount`,
and the array is skipped when nothing draws it. All of those plus `regions` and
`threshold` are reported either way, so the visible surface is identical.

**Since DEC-H5 `observedMax` is no longer the ramp.** The ramp is fixed at
`HEAT_CAP`, so this is the highest score PRESENT — reported only so the legend
can still describe the data on screen, which a constant ramp otherwise removes.
`aboveThresholdCount` drives the legend's "nothing scores above the bar"
message; it used to be inferred from `max <= threshold`, which worked only
because the max was observed and would have died silently under a fixed ramp.

**All four derive reductions are one pass** (DEC-H6/H10). The `values()` spread,
`cellsAboveThreshold`, the `cells.map` that allocated a score array, and
`heatScale`'s own scan were four full-length walks over up to 23 912 cells,
three times per move. They are independent reductions over the same sequence, so
they fuse into the single loop in `update`. Derive was measured at ~1.1 s per
refresh at the chunk cap before this — see `derive-growth.test.ts`.

**This withholds nothing from anything that needs cells.** Cell-level algorithms
run _here_, against the index: the geo-event's hill climb makes thousands of
`cellState` reads as synchronous callbacks that cannot cross a structured clone,
so it returns a finished event rather than the field it walked. NPC navigation is
designed the same way — its plan notes that `connectedComponents` produces
"coloured slabs for display, not a traversal graph". The rule both follow is
**compute where the data lives, send the answer**, and `includeCells` is a flag
rather than a deletion because the cells layer still needs the array when it is
switched on.

## Examples

```ts
const pipeline = new DemoPipeline({ source, table });
const snapshot = await pipeline.update({ lat: 50.94, lng: 6.96 }, "walkable");

// The default configuration: regions, threshold, observedMax,
// aboveThresholdCount and cellCount, but no ~24 000-cell array to clone.
const lean = await pipeline.update(at, "walkable", undefined, undefined, {
  includeCells: false,
});
```

## Tests

`demo-pipeline.test.ts` covers `chunkFor` — four positions where the two
plausible computations diverge, plus a 1600-point sweep. The rest is covered
indirectly through `heat-colours.test.ts` and by the package gate's typecheck
against the real `gps-plus-slam-osm` API. Its remaining behaviour (fetch failure
collection, no-refetch) is worth a test with a fake source — see the follow-ups
doc.

It also holds **the snapshot's serialisability guard**, which lives here rather
than in `osm-store.test.ts` on purpose: `osm-store.ts` excludes the snapshot
from RTK's runtime scan on both the action and the state side, and a round-trip
of a fixture written next to the assertion would only prove the fixture is
serialisable. This drives the real producer and round-trips what it emits.

- The fixture is a **way**, not a node — a node scored too few adjacent cells to
  form a connected component, so `snapshot.regions` was `[]` and the guard never
  reached the only deeply nested part of `DemoSnapshot` (`outline` is three
  levels of array) nor its `minScore`/`maxScore`, which can be `±Infinity` and
  which `JSON.stringify` turns into `"null"` without a word. All three
  collections are now asserted non-empty.
- The comparison is `toStrictEqual`. `toEqual` ignores object type mismatch, so
  a class instance with plain data fields round-trips to an equal plain object —
  precisely what RTK's `isPlainObject` scan would have caught, so the
  replacement would otherwise have been weaker than what it replaced. A
  companion test asserts both halves of that difference, so loosening the guard
  back to `toEqual` fails a line rather than going quiet.

## `DemoSnapshot.timings` — stages 1–5, and why only five

Added 2026-08-11 (click-path plan §8 milestone 2). `update` owns fetch, parse,
merge, score and derive; the terrain join, the mesh build, the structured clone
and the draw happen outside it and are added by the worker handler and the page.
**Reporting all nine from here would produce a "complete" breakdown quietly
missing four stages** — the plan's own failure mode, one level down.

- **REQUIRED, not optional.** `update` is the only producer of a snapshot and
  always measures, so optional could only mean "a future path dropped it
  silently". Hand-built fixtures use `ZERO_STAGE_TIMINGS`.
- **Per-tile source costs are SUMMED, never sampled.** A working set is 1–3
  tiles depending on how near a res-7 boundary the click landed, so sampling
  would divide the fetch stage by three exactly where the click is slowest and
  read correctly everywhere else.
- **`mergeMs` is clocked apart from `fetchMs` although `acceptTile` runs inside
  the fetch loop.** Stage 3 is the term predicted to grow across a session —
  `this.tiles` never evicts, so `mergeTiles` re-merges everything on every
  accept and clicking around is quadratic in tiles visited. Folded into
  fetching, that growth would be invisible, and it is the term nothing has ever
  measured.
- **`fetchMs` and `pipelineMs` are wall clocks, and `fetchMs` is what makes the fetch parts
  falsifiable.** `click-timings.ts` subtracts the per-tile parts from it and
  reports the difference as `fetchUnattributedMs`. Any set of plausible
  per-stage numbers adds up to something;
  only a separately measured whole can say the parts are wrong.
- **`tilesUnmeasured` is a count, not an absence.** A fixture-backed run must
  not read as a click whose network cost nothing.
- Every duration is floored at zero, for the reason `elapsedMs` gives in the OSM
  package: a negative makes the reconciliation close by cancelling, so the gate
  that would catch a clock problem goes quiet exactly when it should shout.

Covered by `pipeline-timings.test.ts`.
