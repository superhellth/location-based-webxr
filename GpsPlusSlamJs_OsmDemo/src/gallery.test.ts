/**
 * The gallery's layout arithmetic (W7, DEC-R6-32).
 *
 * WHY THIS IS THE ONLY UNIT-TESTED PART. `buildGallery` needs a `WebGLRenderer`
 * and cannot be constructed here — the same constraint `building-view` lives
 * under. What CAN be wrong without a GPU is the layout: models overlapping each
 * other, or the whole sheet drifting off-centre so the default camera frames
 * half of it. Both look like "the page is broken" rather than like a layout bug.
 *
 * The e2e half — that the page loads, draws something, and logs no error — is in
 * `playwright-tests/`.
