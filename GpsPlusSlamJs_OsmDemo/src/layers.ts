/**
 * Which geometries the views are asked to build — the layer registry.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS THE ACTUAL DELIVERABLE of the 3D layer work (DEC-R2-12). The feedback
 * put it plainly: _"Hauptsache, dass es so ein bisschen modularisiert ist, dass man
 * das auch dann einzeln rendern kann"_. Individual builders can arrive one at a time
 * and each is straightforward; the seam that lets a later AR mode ask for buildings
 * plus POI markers and skip ground plates is the part that is expensive to retrofit.
 * So it lands first, and the two layers that already existed are migrated through it
 * **before** any new one is written — which is the only way the migration is
 * verifiable, because there is a known-good picture to compare against.
 *
 * WHY INDEPENDENT TOGGLES RATHER THAN A MODE (DEC-R2-10). A two-state
 * `cells ↔ areas` switch was offered and rejected for a specific reason: it makes it
 * impossible to view a merged area **over** the cells that produced it, which is the
 * first check anyone performs when a region looks wrong. One mechanism therefore
 * serves both the layer question and the cells/areas question, because they are the
 * same feature.
 *
 * WHY A PLAIN RECORD RATHER THAN A `Set`. This lives in a Redux slice. A `Set` is
 * rejected by RTK's serialisability scan and dropped by `structuredClone`, so it
 * would break both the store and the worker boundary — silently, in the clone's
 * case.

 * Everything EXCEPT `plates` and `cells` (DEC-R7b-5, DEC-R7b-6).
 *
 * THIS REVERSES DEC-R4-4 FOR TWO LAYERS, and the reversal is deliberate rather
 * than drift. Round 4 set every layer on from this user's own words —
 * _"standardmäßig sollten alle an sein, also auch Landuse, Roads, POI"_ — and
 * round 8's session asked for two of them back off, having seen what the demo
 * looks like since. Roads and POI stay on, so the round-4 request is honoured
 * where it still holds.
 *
 * **`plates` (landuse) off**, because the terrain relief now carries the ground
 * on its own. That is the real change since round 4: landuse used to be the only
 * thing giving the ground any structure, and the session's verdict on seeing it
 * without was _"das wirkt deutlich sinnvoller"_. Note the cost — the plate
 * colour was round 7's highest-uncertainty change and nobody will look at it
 * again unless it is deliberately scheduled.
 *
 * **`cells` off**, because the 2D map draws one Leaflet polygon per cell and the
 * final scoring ring is ~2 989 of them. The 3D grid is a single merged draw call
 * and costs almost nothing, so this is a composition decision in 3D and a real
 * cost in 2D.
 *
 * **`cells` off DEPENDS on region selection existing** (DEC-R7b-3a, landed
 * first). The cell click used to be the only route to a score explanation, so
 * hiding cells by default without a clickable region would have shipped a first
 * frame with no way to ask "why does this score that" — a strictly worse demo,
 * as an improvement.
 *
 * COST, STATED RATHER THAN DISCOVERED (N7): every layer on multiplies the
 * per-publish rebuild, and the 30 FPS the notes accept was measured with three
 * layers on. Two fewer by default moves back toward that, which is a side
 * benefit rather than the reason.
