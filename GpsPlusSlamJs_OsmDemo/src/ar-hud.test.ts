 * The AR readout's surface and its sampling cadence.
 *
 * WHY THESE TESTS MATTER. Two failures here are silent and both have precedent
 * in this demo. A readout outside the dom-overlay root is invisible for exactly
 * the session it measures (`ar-toast.ts` records that finding). And an element
 * left permanently inside `#ar-root` keeps a full-viewport, click-eating layer
 * over the whole page whenever AR is NOT running (`ar-mode.ts` records that
 * one, as a regression that shipped).
