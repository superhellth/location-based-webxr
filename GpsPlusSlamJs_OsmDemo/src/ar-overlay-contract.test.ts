/**
 * The `dom-overlay` contract items the r541 field report ran into.
 *
 * **This file used to assert the opposite of what it now asserts**, and the
 * reversal is the useful part. It required `viewport-fit=cover` on the grounds
 * that `env(safe-area-inset-*)` returns 0 without it — true, and beside the
 * point, because nothing in this package reads a safe-area inset. Opting in also
 * extends the layout viewport UNDER the system bars, so the only LIVE effect was
 * to push a bottom-anchored bar further down: the wrong direction for the very
 * symptom it was meant to help. Caught in review of PR #333.
 *
 * What is pinned now is the COUPLING rather than either half, because either
 * half alone is a defect:
 *
 * - `cover` without a consumer moves content under the system bars for nothing.
 * - a consumer without `cover` silently resolves every inset to 0, which is CSS
 *   that reads as correct and does nothing.
