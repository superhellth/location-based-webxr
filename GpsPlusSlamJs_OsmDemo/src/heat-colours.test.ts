/**
 * The heat scale.
 *
 * WHY THESE TESTS MATTER MORE THAN THEY LOOK. This module is how Iteration 8
 * answers "are the unbounded thresholds practically pickable?" — and a colour
 * ramp can make that question unanswerable by accident. A linear ramp on a
 * multiplicative quantity puts one outlier at the top and everything else at
 * the bottom, so the map looks empty regardless of what the data says, and the
 * session concludes "the scores are unusable" when what was unusable was the
 * picture.
 *
 * So the tests pin the two properties that keep the picture honest: equal
 * ratios get equal colour steps, and a degenerate scale collapses to flat
 * rather than to NaN.
