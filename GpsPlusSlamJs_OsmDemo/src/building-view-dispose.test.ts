/**
 * `BuildingView` disposes its scene-parented meshes through the framework's
 * shared `disposeObject3D`, not a private copy.
 *
 * WHY THIS TEST EXISTS. The private `disposeMesh` this replaces was the
 * sharpest case in the 2026-08-24 duplicated-helpers review: the shared helper
 * lives in a package `GpsPlusSlamJs_OsmDemo` already depends on, so nothing
 * structural prevented reuse — only not knowing it was there.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT A PURE WIRING TEST. The two functions are NOT equivalent, and
 * the swap is only safe because of a precondition nobody had written down:
 * `disposeObject3D` walks every DESCENDANT and disposes each material's `.map`
 * TEXTURE, neither of which the private copy did. On a mesh with children, or
 * one sharing a texture with something that outlives it, the swap would
 * over-dispose — and three.js does not report drawing a freed resource, so the
 * symptom is silent absence, exactly the failure mode `building-view.ts`'s own
 * teardown comments are about. So this file pins the PRECONDITION first and the
 * wiring second.
 *
 * Runtime coverage is possible here and only here: `BuildingView` constructs a
 * `THREE.WebGLRenderer` and cannot be instantiated in the unit suite, but the
 * two meshes it disposes are built from ingredients that CAN be — a cone plus a
 * `MeshStandardMaterial` for the route agent, and `cellFaceMaterial()` for the
 * cell grid. The source-text half then checks that the production file actually
 * routes through the shared helper, which no runtime test could see.
 *
 * @see building-view.ts.md
