/**
 * `click-timings.ts` — the reconciliation, and the arithmetic that must not lie.
 *
 * Why these tests matter: this module is the plan's correctness gate. §0.3 item
 * 2 says "draw no conclusion from a breakdown that does not add up", and the
 * only way that rule has teeth is if the residual is DERIVED from a separately
 * measured whole rather than back-filled to make the sum close. Every assertion
 * here is about a way the arithmetic could quietly close a gap that is really
 * there.
 *
 * Being a pure function is what makes it testable at all: the composition can
 * be driven with exact numbers, which is the half of §5's seeded-clock mandate
 * that the source-level tests could not reach — there, a fake clock can charge
 * `response.text()` but not `JSON.parse`.
