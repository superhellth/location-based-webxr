 * WHY IT SHARES THE PIPELINE RATHER THAN FETCHING ITS OWN DATA. The 3D view is
 * here to verify the MESH code — `building:part` suppression, wall normals,
 * roof shapes, the `isApproximate` flag — and it can only do that if it is
 * looking at exactly the features the 2D view scored. Two fetch paths would
 * mean a discrepancy could be the data rather than the geometry.
 *
 * WHY THE PACKAGE DOES NOT DO THIS. `gps-plus-slam-osm` produces `Float32Array`
 * positions and normals plus `Uint32Array` indices and stops there, because it
 * must not depend on `three` (plan §4.2). Everything below is the three lines
 * that turn those buffers into a mesh, and they belong in the consumer.

 *
 * - **4000** put every building in a res-7 fetch tile inside the frustum, so the
 *   demo drew geometry three to five kilometres away. The whole tile was ONE
 *   merged mesh, so nothing could be culled and all of it was really drawn.
 * - **1200** fixed that, and the next testing session said the world now felt
 *   claustrophobic on the desktop — _"mindestens doppelt so weit"_.
 * - **2400** is that request, and it is affordable now for a reason that has
 *   nothing to do with taste: **W20 chunked the geometry**, so the frustum
 *   actually culls and distance costs what is VISIBLE rather than everything
 *   fetched. The trade the 1200 was priced against no longer exists.
 *
 * **IT IS EXACTLY `TERRAIN_EXTENT_M`, and that is the constraint rather than a
 * coincidence.** The ground plane reaches `TERRAIN_EXTENT_M` along each axis and
 * then stops; a far plane beyond it lets the default view see the edge of the
 * world, which is finding R2-9 (buildings standing on nothing) returning. The
 * three constants move together or not at all — `far-field.test.ts` asserts it.
 *
 * AR will still want its own number: `AR_CAMERA_FAR` is 200 in the framework,
 * nothing in this demo enters AR yet, and the draw-call readout is how that gets

 * Upper bound on plane subdivisions per axis.
 *
 * RAISED FROM 128 TO 256 ON 2026-07-30, because the measurement that justified
 * 128 does not reproduce. The old comment here read: "Deriving the segment count
 * purely from extent / spacing gives 234 at the 2.8 km extent - a 55 000-vertex
 * plane that setTerrain walks and then re-normals on every terrain update. That
 * tripled three e2e tests (3.7 s -> 12.6 s each) and made the suite flaky."
 *
 * Re-measured directly, by instrumenting `setTerrain` and counting its calls:
 *
 *   128 segments (16 641 vertices)   1 call per load, 12 ms total
 *   234 segments (55 225 vertices)   1 call per load, 30 ms total
 *   full e2e suite at 234            38 passed in 1.5 min, unchanged
 *
 * **One call per load, not hundreds.** A +9 s per-test cost would need roughly 300
 * calls of that walk, so whatever produced the original numbers, it was not the
 * per-update vertex walk this constant was introduced to bound. The most likely
 * culprit is the era it was measured in: the permanent rAF loop that was removed
 * around the same time, or the shader outage that ran from W20 until 2026-07-30
 * and made every ground-touching test behave oddly.
 *
 * RAISED AGAIN, 256 -> 480, WITH THE RE-MEASUREMENT THAT COMMENT DEMANDED (W5,
 * DEC-R5-3, DEC-R5-12). The extent grew from 1400 to 2400 m so the far plane
 * could double, which takes the derived count from 233 to 400. Measured the way
 * the last entry was — the per-call vertex walk plus `computeVertexNormals`, at
 * the sizes actually in play, median of seven:
 *
 *   233 segments (54 756 vertices, extent 1400)   14.3 ms
 *   400 segments (160 801 vertices, extent 2400)  44.4 ms
 *   480 segments (231 361 vertices, extent 2880)  42.3 ms
 *
 * **~3x, once per terrain load rather than per frame**, which is the number that
 * makes this affordable: 44 ms on a position change is a hitch, not a frame-rate
 * cost. (The 480 row measuring the same as 400 is JIT warmth, not a discovery —
 * it is listed because leaving it out would imply a cleaner curve than there is.)
 *
 * 480 is a CEILING, not a target, and it is deliberately STRICTLY above the
 * derived 400. A cap equal to the value it bounds is a ceiling only until someone
 * nudges the extent, and the failure is silent: the plane quietly becomes coarser
 * than the height field, which is the very relief R5-2 reports as invisible.
 * `far-field.test.ts` asserts the strict inequality so that nudge fails a gate
 * instead of costing detail. **If you raise the extent again, re-measure rather
 * than trusting this number.**
 *
 * This also removes the measured payoff that motivated GPU displacement (W23,
 * DEC-R2-24); see the round-2 plan for the deferral and its reasoning.

    // comment explaining why `scene.environment` had to stay unset. That comment
    // was right about the mechanism and its reason has now expired, so the short
    // version stays here and the rest moved to `sky-rig.ts`:
    //
    // W20 set `scene.environment` to that RAW equirect texture. three routes any
    // environment map through its CubeUV path, which expects PMREM-processed
    // input, and with a raw one it emits integer `CUBEUV_*` defines into float
    // assignments. Every `MeshStandardMaterial` then fails to compile, three logs
    // it and silently DOES NOT DRAW the material — so the buildings, the trees,
    // the ground and the plates vanished for ten work items while the status line
    // still reported "21 volumes" and every pixel assertion stayed green.
    //
    // THE FIX IS NOT "LEAVE IT UNSET", IT IS "PMREM IT FIRST", which is what
    // `SkyRig` does. The environment map is what actually makes surfaces shiny —
    // the ingredient DEC-R5-8 deferred to "the shader round", which this is.

      //    in — the shading was mathematically present and perceptually absent.
      //  - `roughness` well below the 1.0 default, which narrows the specular lobe
      //    so neighbouring facets return visibly different amounts of it. Too low
      //    and the ground turns to chrome; 0.42 keeps it reading as ground.
      //  - `flatShading` KEPT, because per-facet normals are what the highlight is
      //    varying over. Smooth shading would average exactly the discontinuity
      //    this is trying to reveal.
      //
      // Accepted, and correct: in genuinely flat terrain this still looks flat.

 *   material across every marker, and freeing those would silently blank the
 *   layer from the next frame on. `disposeObject3D` traverses into DESCENDANTS
 *   and frees material textures, so it could reach a borrowed resource nested
 *   under an owned mesh. Swapping it needs that question answered first, and
 *   the answer is not "probably fine".
 * - **The single-resource sites** (`undergroundLines`, `cellOutlines`,
 *   `routeLine`, `ground`) dispose one geometry and one named material each,
 *   which is less than `disposeObject3D` does, not more.

/**
 * Injects GPU height displacement into a ground material (W23).
 *
 * WHY `onBeforeCompile` RATHER THAN A `ShaderMaterial`. The ground is lit by the
 * scene's own lights and DEC-R2-1's look depends on `MeshStandardMaterial`'s PBR
 * response; reimplementing that in a raw shader would be a second source of truth
 * for how the ground looks. Patching the stock shader keeps every lighting change
 * automatic.
 *
 * WHY A UNIFORM RATHER THAN TWO MATERIALS. `uDisplace` flips between the paths
 * with no recompile, and the same injection serves the height-ramp material — so
 * the ramp stays legible in GPU mode instead of being a CPU-only view.
 *
 * THE PLANE'S LOCAL AXES ARE NOT THE WORLD'S. The geometry is built flat in its
 * own XY and rotated -90 degrees about X, so local `z` becomes world `y` (height)
 * and local `y` becomes world `-z` (north). Displacement therefore goes into
 * `transformed.z`, and the object-space normal of a surface `z = h(x, y)` is
 * `(-dh/dx, -dh/dy, 1)`.
 *
 * ON NORMALS AND `flatShading`. The ground material sets `flatShading: true`, and
 * three.js then derives the fragment normal from screen-space derivatives of the
 * displaced view position — so facets are shaded correctly even without the code
 * below. The vertex normal is computed anyway, because it makes this path correct
 * if `flatShading` is ever turned off, and because shipping displacement with
 * knowingly wrong normals is what `geo-three` does: its shader rewrites
 * `gl_Position` only, so its terrain is lit as if flat.
