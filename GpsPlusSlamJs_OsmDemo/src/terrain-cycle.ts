/**
 * The terrain cycle: a position in, one heightfield out, coalesced.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE RATHER THAN A CLOSURE IN `main.ts`. It is the
 * demo's SECOND async action, and it was the only one not coalesced. `refresh`
 * goes through `latestOnly`; the terrain load did not, so the two could disagree
 * about which position is current: `TerrariumProvider` caches decoded tiles, so
 * a second click can resolve from cache while the first is still fetching, and
 * the older load then lands LAST and wins. The result is buildings for the new
 * position standing on the relief of the old one, with a status line confidently
 * reporting the old one's `reliefM`. Nothing about that points at concurrency.
 *
 * Latest-wins rather than a lock, for the same reason `refresh-cycle.ts` gives:
 * refusing a click while a fetch is in flight would make the map feel broken.
 * The intermediate load is what gets dropped, never the user's final intent.
 *
 * WHY IT REPORTS THROUGH A CALLBACK instead of returning the field. The caller
 * has to update four things at once — the heightfield the 3D view stands on, the
 * status-line note, the view's own copy, and the attribution — and they must
 * move together or the screen says one thing while it draws another. One `apply`
 * makes that atomic by construction.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED WITH THE WORKER. The sampling itself moved (~55 000 posts once the
 * terrain covers the rendered extent), so this file is now the coalescing wrapper
 * around an RPC call rather than around the sampler. The coalescing is still
 * needed for exactly the reason above — the worker's tile cache makes a second
 * request resolve faster than the first just as readily as the provider's did.
 *
 * @see terrain-cycle.ts.md
