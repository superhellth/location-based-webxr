/**
 * Which contributing element to show first.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS REPLACES. The provenance list sorted contributors descending by
 * factor and cut at eight. A hard veto has factor `0`, so it sorted **last** and
 * was the first entry dropped — meaning "why is this cell zero?", the question
 * the provenance map exists to answer, was the one question the list was worst
 * at. On a cemetery tile next to the cathedral, the `landuse=cemetery` rule that
 * zeroed everything was exactly the row that fell off the end.
 *
 * WHY NOT "DISTANCE FROM 1". It is the obvious repair and it fails the same case
 * more quietly: a veto scores `|0 - 1| = 1`, so one `5x` contributor outranks it
 * and the veto is dropped again — this time by a rule that looks principled.
 *
 * WHY `|log(factor)|`. The model is multiplicative, so the size of a claim is
 * its RATIO to the identity, not its distance from it. `log` turns that ratio
 * into a magnitude: `0` goes to infinity and always leads; `0.5` and `2` rank
 * equally, because halving and doubling are the same size of statement; and `1`
 * goes to zero and sinks to the bottom without being removed. It is also the
 * same transform `heat-colours.ts` already applies to the same numbers, so the
 * list and the map agree about what "a big contribution" means.
 *
