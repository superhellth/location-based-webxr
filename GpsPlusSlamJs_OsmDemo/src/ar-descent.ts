/**
 * How long the entry waits for the elevation estimate before giving up on it.

 * and on a device that supplies neither it never engages at all — so a wait with
 * no ceiling is a black screen with no way out, which is a worse failure than
 * the jump this gate exists to remove.
 *
 * **THREE SECONDS IS A GUESS, and it may well be too short.** The estimator
 * engages at `AUTO_ENGAGE_CONFIDENCE`, and its confidence is built from depth
 * observations that need MOTION -- `ar-mode.test.ts` reaches an engaged state
 * only by walking for ~5 s, and a user entering AR is standing still. If that
 * is representative, this fallback is the NORMAL path rather than the
 * exception, and the correction then arrives through the ease at 1.5 m/s: a
 * 10 m residual takes 6.7 s.
 *
 * **DEC-L2 CHANGED THE COMPARISON, not the conclusion.** Against the 6 s
 * descent this paragraph was written for, that correction outlasted the whole
 * animation; against 12 s a 10 m residual now fits inside it. It is still not
 * settled: the 6.7 s runs from ENGAGEMENT, and DEC-M2 (later in the same PR)
 * moved the start — the descent now also waits for the DOM veil, which cannot
 * go before `ENTRY_DOM_VEIL_HOLD_S + ENTRY_DOM_VEIL_FADE_S` = 4 s and holds
 * until `ENTRY_READY_MAX_WAIT_S + ENTRY_DOM_VEIL_FADE_S` = 10 s on the
 * ceiling path. So on this fallback path the descent starts at `firstFrame +
 * 4…10 s`, lands at `firstFrame + 16…22 s`, and the correction is hidden if
 * the estimator engages within ~9.3–15.3 s of the first frame; a 20 m
 * residual outlasts the animation at any engagement time. Filed with the
 * arithmetic and the field measurement to take, in
 * `2026-08-21-1120-ar-entry-gate-fallback-may-be-the-normal-path-followup.md`.
 *
 * **And at today's constants this wait is never the binding gate.** The veil's
 * 4 s minimum subsumes this 3 s, so by the time `descentMayStart` is consulted
 * the fallback has already expired on every path —
 * `ar-entry-dom-veil.test.ts` pins that inequality precisely so reversing it
 * cannot silently make this constant load-bearing again.
 *
 * It is NOT raised speculatively: a longer black screen is a real cost, and
 * without the engagement distribution any other value is the same guess.
