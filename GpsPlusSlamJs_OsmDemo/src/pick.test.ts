/**
 * What a click in the 3D view selects (W12).
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE. Picking used to be four lines inside
 * `BuildingView`, answering one question: which cell is under the pointer. W12
 * makes it answer "which *thing*", and the moment there are two kinds of answer
 * there is a precedence question, a nearest-hit question, and a "what happens
 * over a building" question — none of which can be tested through a class that
 * needs a `WebGLRenderer`.
 *
 * So the raycast stays in the view and the DECISION moves here, which is the
 * pattern this repo already uses for shader and worker logic: keep the judgement
 * in a pure module the device layer thinly wraps.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT THAT MUST SURVIVE: buildings are not selectable. That was a
 * deliberate choice — hitting a building should not silently select the cell
 * behind it *as if the building had been chosen* — and W12 must not undo it as a
 * side effect of making markers clickable.
