/**
 * Turning unbounded affordance scores into colours a human can read.
 *
 * THIS MODULE IS WHERE ITERATION 8's SECOND QUESTION GETS ANSWERED. The scoring
 * model is multiplicative and deliberately unbounded (the plan's §2 carries the
 * flaw over from the C# reference on purpose), so a cell overlapped by five
 * mapped features scores far higher than the identical physical surface with one
 * feature mapped. The open question was whether that makes thresholds
 * *practically* un-pickable in real data.
 *
 * A linear colour ramp would answer it badly: one cell at 1587 flattens
 * everything else to the bottom of the scale, and the map would look empty
 * whatever the data said. So the ramp is **logarithmic above the threshold**,
 * which is the honest presentation of a multiplicative quantity — equal ratios
 * get equal colour steps, exactly as equal ratios get equal products.
 *
 * The scale is also **reported**, not hidden: `describeScale` gives the numbers
 * behind the picture so "looks plausible" can be checked against "1 is the
 * identity, 10 is one strong rule, 100 is two".
 *

 * the hottest cell to leave the retained set and every remaining cell brightens
 * with no change in its own data. **The picture reported a change that did not
 * happen.** Tolerable on a desktop where you click between places; in AR the
 * user walks continuously and the grid is what they are reading. It also made
 * two observations incomparable — here versus a kilometre back, today versus
 * last week.
 *
 * WHY 1e4 SPECIFICALLY, and it is measured rather than chosen. The decade
 * histogram over the corpus (`corpus-score-distribution.test.ts`,
 * `category-score-distributions.test.ts`) says:
 *
 * - The region above 1e4 holds ~10-14 % of `walkable` cells spread over EIGHT
 *   orders of magnitude. Up there a product-of-factors score is largely reading
 *   how thoroughly the patch was mapped rather than how walkable it is.
 * - Roughly two thirds of coloured cells sit below 1000, which is where the
 *   resolution belongs.
 * - It clips at most 3.9 % of every other category — less than the 9.8-13.9 %
 *   accepted for `walkable`, the category it was chosen for.
 *
 * **The accepted cost, stated:** at Heidelberg roughly one coloured `walkable`
 * cell in four saturates, so an outstanding spot stops being distinguishable
 * from a merely very good one.
 *
 * **The objection this file used to carry is measured and does not hold.** It
 * said a fixed scale "would make most categories look uniformly dark and hide
 * precisely the variation being judged". The ramp is logarithmic, so at the
 * weaker corpus site the five non-`walkable` categories' maxima land at 68 %,
 * 76 %, 91 %, 95 % and 107 % of a ramp running 1 → 1e4.

  // cap does not: thresholds come from a publicly editable Google Sheet through
  // `toNumber`, and `legend-model.test.ts` already exercises 250 000 as a
  // "large threshold off the rule sheet".
  //
  // At `threshold >= HEAT_CAP` the span goes non-positive, `heatFraction`'s
  // guard returns 0 for every score, and the entire grid paints the ramp's dark
  // end with no message — a uniformly dark map caused by one sheet edit, which
  // is the same class of failure as the `#NaNNaNNaN` scar that guard was
  // written for.

  // ONLY WHERE IT IS ACTUALLY DEGENERATE. The first version of this guard was

  // promise that "the same score is the same colour everywhere", which is the
  // entire point of DEC-H5 (r513 review).

 * it, which is the case the owner saw. It is NOT universal: `fixedScale` falls
 * back to `threshold * 10` once a threshold reaches the cap, so a rule table
 * with a high threshold can put a ten-digit number on this label. Spelling that
 * out unconditionally would reintroduce exactly the defect DEC-R6b-6 removed,
 * in the place it was reported from. The premise was checked against
 * `scaleFor` rather than taken from the decision text.
 *
 * Grouped with a NARROW NO-BREAK space (U+202F) rather than commas: the legend
 * is read at a glance
 * on a phone, and a comma sits one keystroke away from meaning a decimal point
 * in most of the languages this demo is looked at in.
 *
 * NO-BREAK matters as much as narrow. A plain thin space (U+2009) is a line-break
 * opportunity under UAX-14, and `#legend` is a wrapping flex row — so on a narrow
 * header the endpoint could render as `10` on one line and `000` on the next,
 * which is the line instability DEC-R6b-6 exists to prevent, reintroduced by its
