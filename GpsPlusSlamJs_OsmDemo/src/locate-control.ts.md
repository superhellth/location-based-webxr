# `locate-control.ts`

**Purpose.** A "my location" button in the map's corner, driving `map.locate()` and reporting the outcome.

## Public API

- `class LocateControl`
  - `constructor({ map, onLocated, onError })` — adds itself to the map at
    `bottomright` (DEC-R2-3, the Google Maps convention the feedback named).
    This line said `bottomleft` until round three and had always been wrong.
  - `start()` — one-shot locate, exactly what pressing the button does.
    Idempotent while one is already in flight. **Public since round three**
    (G6, DEC-W2): the AR button performs this step itself when the app does not
    yet know where the user is, and it goes through the SAME entry point the
    button's own handler uses — a second path into `map.locate()` would be a
    second place for this control's state machine to fall out of step with what
    is actually in flight.
  - `startWatch()` / `stopWatch()` — follow the user continuously instead of
    taking one fix (AR milestone 3). Both idempotent.
  - `dispose()` — cancels the pending label reset.
- `LocatedFix` — the shape handed to `onLocated`: `{ lat, lng, accuracyM?,
altitude, altitudeAccuracy, heading, speed, timestamp }`.
  - **WIDENED 2026-08-14 from `{ lat, lng, accuracyM? }`.** The vertical and
    temporal fields were being discarded at this boundary even though Leaflet
    copies every numeric `coords` property onto its event. That is why the
    fusion's vertical solve could never work: `applyAltitudeOverride` fits
    `ref[1] - odom[1]` weighted by `altitudeAccuracy`, so with neither field
    `alignmentMatrix[13]` stays structurally zero and the AR HUD reports a
    confident `0.00 m`. `gps-registration.ts` is the consumer that needs them.
  - The four optional fields are normalised to `null`, not left `undefined`:
    `@types/leaflet` declares them as plain `number`, but Leaflet only copies
    what the browser provided, so they are absent on most indoor and all desktop
    fixes. The framework's `GpsPosition` wants `null`, and `undefined` reaching
    the weight maths would produce `NaN` rather than a skipped term.
  - `timestamp` falls back to `Date.now()` for the same reason: a synthetic
    `locationfound` may omit it, and a `NaN` timestamp poisons time weighting.
- The button carries `data-state` (a `LocateState`) and class `locate-button`; both are the e2e's handles.

## Invariants & assumptions

- **It is a SQUARE ICON BUTTON, bottom-right (DEC-R2-3).** An inline SVG map pin —
  not an emoji (renders differently per platform, cannot inherit `currentColor`)
  and not an image (a network request for four path commands). Bottom-right is the
  maps convention the feedback named; Leaflet puts its attribution control in the
  same corner, so the button stacks ABOVE it and the ODbL credit stays visible.
- **The label is no longer the visible text, and that is the risky part.** It used
  to be `textContent`, so removing it would have left a button that says nothing
  to a screen reader and nothing on touch (where `title` never appears). The four
  states now drive THREE channels: `data-state` for the CSS (a pulsing pin is the
  in-progress state `CLAUDE.md` requires), `title` + `aria-label` + `aria-busy`
  for the wording and for AT, and the status line for the failures. Because a
  collapsed header hides the status line, DEC-R2-15 makes an error expand it.
- **The old button changed SIZE when it failed** — "my location" to "location
  permission denied". A fixed square cannot.

- **No new dependency.** Leaflet has no built-in locate _button_, but `map.locate()` is built in and wraps `navigator.geolocation` with `locationfound` / `locationerror`, so this is a div, a click handler and two listeners rather than a plugin.
- **The watch reuses `map.locate`, so there is only ever ONE source of position**
  (AR milestone 3). `locationfound` already flows to `onLocated`, which is the
  one place a new position enters the store; a parallel `watchPosition` would be
  a second source for the same fact, and the two could disagree about which fix
  is current.
  - **`watch: true` does NOT mean "refetch on every fix".** Leaflet delivers
    roughly 1 Hz, the scoring pass takes 15–90 s, and `refresh` is `latestOnly`
    — so acting on every fix aborts every run and nothing ever publishes.
    [`ar-walk-controller.ts`](ar-walk-controller.ts.md) is what makes this safe
    to turn on; turning it on without that controller IS the §2.6 starvation
    bug.
  - **The watch does not drive the BUTTON.** A background follow that flashed
    "Located" once a second, for something the user never pressed, would be
    wrong — and it would re-arm a reset timer each time. The button belongs to
    the one-shot it was pressed for, which is exactly `state === "locating"`.
  - **A watch error is reported ONCE per outage.** `watchPosition` re-fires its
    error callback on every timeout, so an unguarded path pushes a toast a
    second for as long as the user stays indoors, burying every other message
    the app has. The next successful fix rearms it, so a second outage is
    reported again.
  - **`stopLocate()` also cancels a one-shot in flight** and fires no event,
    which is the other reason `stopWatch` leaves the button alone: a `locating`
    button would otherwise stay pulsing with nothing left to end it.
- **`disableClickPropagation` is load-bearing.** Without it a click on the button also reaches the map underneath, which reads it as "the user clicked here to move" — so pressing "my location" would first teleport them to the button's own position.
- **`setView: false`, and the app must then actually pan.** Moving the map is the app's decision rather than a side effect of asking where we are — but for a while nothing made that decision, and a fix left the viewport at the start position with the marker, the new grid and the fetch box all off screen at zoom 18. A working button and a dead one looked identical. `main.ts` now calls `MapView.centreOn` on the **locate path only**: a map click already happens where the user is looking, and recentring there would yank the map out from under them. The fix still dispatches the same `positionChanged` a click does, so there is no second refresh path.
- **Disabled only while in flight.** Every terminal state, including the failures, is immediately retryable; a permission the user has just granted in browser settings should work on the next tap.
- **A failure must never blank the map.** A refused GPS permission says nothing about the data on screen. The error is dispatched through the action that preserves the snapshot.
- The button relaxes back to `idle` after `MESSAGE_LINGER_MS`, so a stale failure message does not sit on screen forever. `dispose()` cancels that timer.

## Examples

```ts
new LocateControl({
  map: mapView.map,
  onLocated: (position) => store.dispatch(actions.positionChanged(position)),
  onError: (message) => store.dispatch(actions.nonFatalError(message)),
});
```

## Tests

The labels and error mapping are unit-tested in `locate-state.test.ts`. The DOM and Leaflet wiring are covered end to end in `playwright-tests/boot-and-shell.spec.js`, both paths as the async-feedback rule requires: _"moves the user to a real fix, and says so while it is working"_ (with a granted permission and a set geolocation, asserting the button reaches a terminal state and the refresh ran) and _"reports a denied permission instead of hanging on 'locating…'"_ (asserting the error reaches the status line).
