# `locate-control.ts`

**Purpose.** A "my location" button in the map's corner, driving `map.locate()` and reporting the outcome.

## Public API

- `class LocateControl`
  - `constructor({ map, onLocated, onError })` — adds itself to the map at `bottomleft`.
  - `dispose()` — cancels the pending label reset.
- The button carries `data-state` (a `LocateState`) and class `locate-button`; both are the e2e's handles.

## Invariants & assumptions

- **It is a SQUARE ICON BUTTON, bottom-right (DEC-R2-3).** An inline SVG map pin —
  not an emoji (renders differently per platform, cannot inherit `currentColor`)
  and not an image (a network request for four path commands). Bottom-right is the
  maps convention the feedback named; Leaflet puts its attribution control in the
  same corner, so the button stacks ABOVE it and the ODbL credit stays visible.
- **The label is no longer the visible text, and that is the risky part.** It used
  to be `textContent`, so removing it would have left a button that says nothing
  to a screen reader and nothing on touch (where `title` never appears). The four
  states now drive THREE channels: `data-state` for the CSS (a pulsing pin is the
  in-progress state `CLAUDE.md` requires), `title` + `aria-label` + `aria-busy`
  for the wording and for AT, and the status line for the failures. Because a
  collapsed header hides the status line, DEC-R2-15 makes an error expand it.
- **The old button changed SIZE when it failed** — "my location" to "location
  permission denied". A fixed square cannot.

- **No new dependency.** Leaflet has no built-in locate _button_, but `map.locate()` is built in and wraps `navigator.geolocation` with `locationfound` / `locationerror`, so this is a div, a click handler and two listeners rather than a plugin.
- **`disableClickPropagation` is load-bearing.** Without it a click on the button also reaches the map underneath, which reads it as "the user clicked here to move" — so pressing "my location" would first teleport them to the button's own position.
- **`setView: false`, and the app must then actually pan.** Moving the map is the app's decision rather than a side effect of asking where we are — but for a while nothing made that decision, and a fix left the viewport at the start position with the marker, the new grid and the fetch box all off screen at zoom 18. A working button and a dead one looked identical. `main.ts` now calls `MapView.centreOn` on the **locate path only**: a map click already happens where the user is looking, and recentring there would yank the map out from under them. The fix still dispatches the same `positionChanged` a click does, so there is no second refresh path.
- **Disabled only while in flight.** Every terminal state, including the failures, is immediately retryable; a permission the user has just granted in browser settings should work on the next tap.
- **A failure must never blank the map.** A refused GPS permission says nothing about the data on screen. The error is dispatched through the action that preserves the snapshot.
- The button relaxes back to `idle` after `MESSAGE_LINGER_MS`, so a stale failure message does not sit on screen forever. `dispose()` cancels that timer.

## Examples

```ts
new LocateControl({
  map: mapView.map,
  onLocated: (position) => store.dispatch(actions.positionChanged(position)),
  onError: (message) => store.dispatch(actions.nonFatalError(message)),
});
```

## Tests

The labels and error mapping are unit-tested in `locate-state.test.ts`. The DOM and Leaflet wiring are covered end to end in `playwright-tests/boot-and-shell.spec.js`, both paths as the async-feedback rule requires: _"moves the user to a real fix, and says so while it is working"_ (with a granted permission and a set geolocation, asserting the button reaches a terminal state and the refresh ran) and _"reports a denied permission instead of hanging on 'locating…'"_ (asserting the error reaches the status line).
