/**
 * The GPS→store→alignment loop, which the demo did not have.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The owner reported that AR mode "doesn't really use the
 * AR framework — there are no automatic updates of the user position, the
 * typical thing the other demos do where GPS events keep arriving, get
 * dispatched into the store, which then does automatic alignments, is missing
 * entirely". It was: the demo received real fixes (`map.locate({watch:true})`)
 * and spent them on FETCHING, never on REGISTRATION. `recordGpsEvent` was never
 * dispatched, so `gpsElements` stayed empty, the alignment matrix never left
 * identity, and `arWorldGroup` was never GPS-registered.
 *
 * WHY A MODULE RATHER THAN LINES IN `main.ts`. `ar-walk-wiring.test.ts` exists
 * because `main.ts` cannot be unit-run — it builds a Leaflet map, a
 * `WebGLRenderer` and a worker — so everything put there can only ever be
 * guarded by matching its source TEXT. That is enough to prove a call is
 * written and nothing about whether it works. This loop has real behaviour
 * worth asserting (does an arriving fix become a dispatched event? is the
 * session ended on exit?), so it lives where a test can run it, and `main.ts`
 * keeps only the two calls a text guard can honestly cover.
 *
