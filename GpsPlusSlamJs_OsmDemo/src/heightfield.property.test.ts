/**
 * Heightfield invariants over arbitrary terrain and arbitrary sample points.
 *
 * Why these tests matter:
 * The example tests pin the slopes someone thought to write down. These pin the
 * two properties every consumer relies on without checking: that `heightAt`
 * always returns a finite number — a `NaN` vertex silently deletes a triangle
 * rather than reporting anything — and that bilinear interpolation never
 * overshoots the data, which is how a sampler invents a spire or a pit that
 * the DEM never contained.
 *
