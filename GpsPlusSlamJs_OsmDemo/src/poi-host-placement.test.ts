/**
 * The renderer half of stage 1: a marker's host actually changes where it draws.
 *
 * WHY THESE TESTS MATTER, and it is not the resolver being re-tested.
 * `poi-hosts.test.ts` proves the RULE — given hosts and layers, which placement.
 * Nothing there can tell whether the answer reaches an instance matrix, and a
 * placement that is computed and then ignored is the exact shape of defect this
 * repo keeps finding: the data is right, the picture is unchanged, and the suite
 * is green. `poi-jitter.test.ts` exists for the same reason, one field earlier.
 *
 * The layer case is the one that cannot be checked any other way. Toggling
 * `plates` changes which markers exist, and the whole reason that rule lives on
 * the main thread is that a toggle never re-runs the worker — so the only place
 * the coupling is observable is here, in what `drawMeshLayers` returns for the
 * same payload under two layer sets.
