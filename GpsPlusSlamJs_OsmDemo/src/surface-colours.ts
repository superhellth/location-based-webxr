/**
 * The two base colours of the terrain, and the relationship between them
 * (DEC-R6b-7).
 *
 * WHY THEY LIVE TOGETHER NOW. They were two literals in two files —
 * `building-view.ts` for the ground plane, `mesh-layers.ts` for the landuse
 * plates that lie on it — and nothing said they were related. Round 6's §2
 * (DEC-R6-6) lightened the ground from `0x3a4356` to `0x6b7280` and left the
 * plate behind, which INVERTED their relationship: the plate had been ~1.6x the
 * ground's relative luminance and became ~0.5x it, a threefold swing. The sixth
 * testing session reported the result as "riesige schwarze Polygone".
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT. It is not the cause of that report. The black polygons
 * were `plates.ts` emitting its triangulator output unreversed, so every face
 * normal pointed DOWN and `flatShading` lit the plates from beneath — black
 * under a low sun whatever the colour said. That is fixed and covered by
 * `plates.test.ts`. **The contrast inversion is a SEPARATE regression that
 * survived the winding fix**, and this file is where it stops being invisible.
 *
 * THE POINT IS THE TEST, NOT THE CONSTANTS. Two numbers in two files can drift
 * silently for a whole round; two numbers with an asserted relationship cannot.
 * `surface-colours.test.ts` fails if someone lightens one and forgets the other,
 * which is exactly what happened.
 *
 * @see surface-colours.ts.md
