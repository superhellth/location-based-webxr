/**
 * Where the terrain grid is sampled, and in whose coordinates.
 *
 * THE DISTINCTION THIS MODULE EXISTS TO MAKE. Until `scene-anchor.ts` fixed the
 * frame, one lat/lng answered three different questions at once — which posts to
 * fetch, where to centre the sampled square, and what the resulting numbers
 * mean. They were the same variable, so nothing could disagree. They are not the
 * same question:
 *
 * - **The frame origin is a coordinate system.** It must stand still, or every
 *   height in the field is expressed against a different zero than the geometry
 *   standing on it.
 * - **The fetch centre and the sample centre are a data window.** They follow
 *   the user, because the ground the user is looking at is the ground worth
 *   having.
 *
 * Welding the two together is what made the whole scene move on every publish.
 * Separating them is the entire fix.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FIXED, CONCRETELY. Round 5A moved the buildings into the fixed frame
 * and left the heightfield in a frame anchored on the user, while `meshOptions`
 * kept reading building ground heights as `field.heightAt(frame.toEnu(position))`
 * — fixed-frame ENU against a user-frame field. The two disagreed by exactly the
 * user's offset from the anchor, so the relief slid under the city by the step
 * distance on every step. Nothing detected it: the round-5A walk test asserts on
 * the frame origin that is SENT, not on the frames the subsystems then use.
 *

/**
 * How far past the sampled square the post lattice is grown.

 * **NOT a `sqrt(2)` margin, and the difference is measured rather than a

 * and the grid reads a SQUARE of half-width `extentM`, so treating the radius as
 * a circumscribed circle over-builds by `sqrt(2)` per axis — twice the posts,
 * for ground nothing ever samples. Harmless at the old 1 400 m extent (110 889
 * posts, inside the cache cap) and not harmless at 2 400 m: it put the lattice
 * at ~321 000 posts against a 250 000 cap, so eviction ran on every load and
 * threw away ~71 000 posts the next load immediately re-fetched.
 *
 * The 5 % that remains is real: the lattice is indexed on Mercator pixels whose
 * pitch changes slightly across the square, and `ensureAround`'s own `+1` covers
 * the bilinear read at the very edge.
