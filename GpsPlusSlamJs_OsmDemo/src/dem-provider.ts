/**
 * The demo's DEM composition: Mapterhorn primary, AWS Terrarium fallback,
 * one caching fetch shared by both.
 *
 * WHY A FACTORY RATHER THAN INLINE WIRING IN THE WORKER. The worker's `init`
 * needs `navigator.storage` and `OffscreenCanvas`, so nothing constructed
 * there can be exercised by a unit test — and the one thing worth pinning
 * about this composition IS its construction: which source is asked first,
 * that the fallback fills only the primary's gaps, and that both share one
 * persistent tile cache. Extracting the wiring behind injected seams (`store`,
 * `decodePng`, `fetchImpl`) makes exactly that testable; the worker supplies
 * the browser-only pieces.
 *
 * WHY PRECEDENCE, NOT CONSENSUS. Mapterhorn is national LiDAR (with Copernicus
 * GLO-30 where none exists) against the AWS tiles' ~30 m SRTM/NED posting — a
 * strictly better source wherever it has data. The full argument (a two-source
 * median degenerates to their average and throws the resolution advantage
 * away) lives in `racing-provider.ts`, the composition this file actually
 * builds; this paragraph used to attribute it to `fallbackProvider`, which
 * this file no longer constructs (PR #329 review).
 *
 * WHY ONE `createCachingTileFetch` FOR BOTH. The cache keys are full request
 * URLs, so the two sources cannot collide — and one wrapper means one stats
 * object and one store namespace to reason about. The store itself is the same
 * OPFS-backed blob store the OSM tiles persist through: its keys are escaped
 * flat filenames, so `https://…` keys coexist with `osm/v2/…` keys the same
 * way `rules/v1/…` already does.

/**
 * Bound on ONE Mapterhorn tile request, ms — an anti-hang guard, nothing more.
 *
 * RAISED FROM 3 s TO 30 s WHEN THE RACE LANDED, because the deadline's JOB
 * changed rather than because the old number was wrong.
 *
 * Under `fallbackProvider` this was the only thing that made the fallback
 * reachable at all: the fallback is consulted only for positions the primary
 * returned `undefined` for, so a merely SLOW primary left no gap and the
 * composition waited for it however long it took. 3 s cut that short and
 * fixed the reported 15 s stall.
 *
 * It also made the primary unwinnable. Measured 2026-08-19 from one machine,
 * every Mapterhorn tile took 3.0-21.7 s — so a 3 s cut-off meant the
 * LiDAR-derived heights were never served, and the stall was traded for a
 * permanent loss of the better data.
 *
 * Under the race nothing waits for this. AWS publishes in ~1 s and Mapterhorn
 * is applied whenever it arrives, so the only thing left to prevent is a
 * request that never settles holding an upgrade slot open for the life of the
 * page. 30 s clears the measured worst case with room.
 *
 * **It is NOT what keeps the terrain gate from firing** — see
 * {@link PUBLISH_DEADLINE_MS}, which is. An earlier version of this file said
 * the fast source's deadline alone did that, which was false: a fast source
 * answering "no coverage" leaves the batch waiting on THIS deadline.

 * the two. The asymmetry survived, inverted — see {@link PRIMARY_DEM_TIMEOUT_MS}
 * — because the roles inverted with it: this one bounds a request the user is
 * waiting on, that one bounds a request nobody is.
 *
 * The plan said "primary-only", and shipping it that way would have left the
 * identical hang open one provider to the right: AWS has no documented rate
 * limit and measured fast, but "measured fast today" is what was said about the
 * primary too, and a fallback that never answers hangs the batch exactly as a
 * primary that never answers did. A deadline whose whole point is that no
 * single source can stall the composition has to cover every source in it.
 *
 * SHORTER than the primary's, and the reason is the roles, not the numbers: a
 * user is waiting on this request, so its deadline is a promise about how long
 * the screen can stay empty; nobody is waiting on the primary's, so that one is
 * only a last resort against a hang. It is comfortably inside the 15 s gate.
 *
 * (This paragraph said "Longer than the primary's" until 2026-08-20 — a

 * so contradicted the correction eighteen lines above it. Found in review of
