 * `datum: 0` regardless of the undulation requested (`heightfield.ts:189`). So
 * for any non-zero undulation — −46.2 at Cologne — `fieldMatchesArDatum`
 * REJECTS the failed field, and if `terrainHasData` is published only inside
 * that gate then `terrainHasData: false` is never published at all.
 *
 * `ar-measurements.ts` calls that flag "THE MOST IMPORTANT FLAG IN THIS
 * INTERFACE" and `describeArMeasurements` puts `terrain: no DEM` in the
 * always-shown collapsed set precisely so a silent terrain failure cannot pass
 * as flat ground. Gated, an AR session whose DEM failed showed NO terrain line —
 * indistinguishable from "the AR field has not landed yet", which is the same
 * silence the flag exists to break.
 *
 * The datum mismatch invalidates the HEIGHT, not the hasData CLAIM, so the two
 * are gated separately. These tests exist because the predicate above was
 * covered in isolation while the payload that consumes it was not — which is
 * exactly how this passed review.
