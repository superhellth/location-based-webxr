/**
 * How much ground one Overpass fetch actually covers.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE. "One res-7 tile" is the unit the whole plan is
 * written in, and it is an abstraction until someone sees it drawn over a city.
 * Two numbers make the picture legible, and neither is obvious:
 *
 * 1. **The query covers the tile's BOUNDING BOX, not the hexagon.**
 *    `buildTileQuery` takes `cellToBoundingBox(tile)`, because Overpass has no
 *    hexagon primitive. So the red box on the map is the honest answer to "what
 *    did we download", and it is strictly larger than the tile the index keys
 *    on.
 * 2. **The gap between them is redundant TRANSFER, not discarded data.**
 *    Nothing filters the response to the hexagon — `acceptTile` merges every
 *    feature and scoring bbox-tests against the CHUNK — so the corners are
 *    indexed and used. What the 1.39× costs is that neighbouring tiles' bboxes
 *    overlap, so shared ground is downloaded once per tile covering it.
 *
 * A res-7 fetch measures **~21 MB** (2026-08-01 matrix sweep, `areal-only`,
 * replicated three ways) **and ~15–90 s, which does not replicate** — see
 * `resolutions.ts` FETCH_RES for why latency here is a range and never a single
 * figure. Seeing the box is worth it — it makes the unit the plan is written in
 * concrete — but it is still not an argument for a smaller `FETCH_RES`, and the
 * reason has CHANGED rather than merely being re-measured:
 *
 * - **The old reason (superseded).** Under the pre-F32 `nwr` form the payload
 *   barely tracked area — res 9 is 49x less ground and still returned 38.7 MB —
 *   so shrinking the tile bought almost nothing. That figure and the ~68 MB /
 *   ~23–110 s it sat beside are both retracted; they describe a query this app
 *   has not issued since 2026-08-03.
 * - **The current reason.** Areal-only restored proportionality (res 7 → res 9
 *   is 21x), so a smaller tile now WOULD be smaller. It is still the wrong move:
 *   `FETCH_RES` was raised 8 → 7 deliberately, to spend bytes on rarer requests,
 *   and that trade is about request count rather than payload.
 *
 * The arithmetic lives here rather than in `map-view.ts` so it can be tested
 * without a DOM — the view is Leaflet wiring and has no unit tests, which is the
 * same gap the `?lat=&lng=` guard and the click race both fell into.
 *
 * @see fetch-extent.ts.md
