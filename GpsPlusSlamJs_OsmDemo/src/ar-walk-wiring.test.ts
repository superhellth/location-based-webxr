/**
 * Guardrail: the walking pieces are actually CONNECTED in `main.ts`.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, stated as precisely as it can be. AR milestone 1 of
 * this plan shipped with three of its central claims false — `setZeroPos` had
 * no dispatcher, `toDemoLatLng` had no production caller, `geoidUndulationM`
 * had no producer — and **four green gates passed all three**. Every module was
 * correct in isolation; nothing asserted they were wired together. Milestone 3
 * adds four more connection points with exactly that shape.
 *
 * WHY SOURCE TEXT rather than behaviour. `main.ts` is the app entry: it
 * constructs a Leaflet map, a `WebGLRenderer` and a worker, so the unit suite
 * cannot run it. And the e2e cannot reach the AR path either — headless
 * Chromium has no WebXR device, so `requestSession` never resolves however the
 * support probe is stubbed. That leaves a static check, which is the same
 * conclusion `building-view-content.test.ts` reached for the same reason, with
 * the same precedent behind it (`agent-loop-config.test.ts`,
 * `internal-subpath-guardrail.test.ts`, `ip-guardrail.test.ts`).
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT DO, said plainly so nobody reads more into a green run: it
 * proves the call is WRITTEN, not that it runs, and not that its arguments are
 * right. The behaviour of each piece is pinned by `ar-walking.test.ts`,
 * `ar-walk-controller.test.ts` and `scene-anchor.test.ts`. This only closes the
 * gap between "each piece works" and "the app uses them" — which is precisely
 * the gap that cost milestone 1 two review rounds.
