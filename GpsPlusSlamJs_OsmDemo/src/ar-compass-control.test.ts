/**
 * Why this test matters: every compass setter is a **silent no-op before the
 * first GPS fix** — the reducer returns state unchanged while `gpsData` is
 * null. So the failure this file exists to prevent is a slider that accepts a
 * drag, shows the new number, and dispatches into a void: the UI and the store
 * then disagree for the rest of the session, with nothing on screen saying so.
 * The latch-and-flush tests are the ones carrying that weight.
