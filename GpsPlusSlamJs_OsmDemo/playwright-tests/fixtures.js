 * Network interception for the e2e suite.
 *
 * WHY EVERY EXTERNAL CALL IS INTERCEPTED, and the first reason is not
 * determinism:
 *
 * 1. **The public Overpass instances are donated infrastructure** with a
 *    measured allocation of two slots per client IP, recovering in ~30 s. A CI
 *    suite that hit them on every push would be an abuse of a shared resource,
 *    and the retry-with-backoff path would make every run minutes long.
 * 2. **The rule table is a live Google Sheet** that anyone with access can edit.
 *    A suite depending on it asserts today's spreadsheet, not today's code.
 * 3. Only then: a test that fails because a third party is slow teaches nothing.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* FAKED. The interception happens at the HTTP layer,
 * so `OverpassSource`, the parser, `CachingSource`, the OPFS store, the index,
 * the scorer, the region builder and the mesh extruder all run for real. A
 * seam inside the app would have been easier and would have tested the seam.

 * Counts the pixels of the 3D pane that sit on a HARD EDGE, and says where they

 *
 * WHAT IT USED TO DO, AND WHY THAT HAD TO CHANGE (§1, DEC-R6-2/R6-4). It matched
 * every pixel against the exact colour ramp of the old painted sky — zenith
 * (16,22,42) to horizon (92,108,140) — and counted the misses. That was exact
 * rather than heuristic, which was the right call while the sky was two
 * hard-coded colours. Round 6 replaced it with a scattering shader whose colours
 * change with the sun, and added ACES tone mapping on top, so NO pixel matches
 * the old ramp any more: the helper reported the entire canvas as non-sky and
 * four tests failed at once.
 *
 * WHY EDGES ARE THE RIGHT INVARIANT. The background — under any sky, at any time
 * of day, before or after tone mapping — is SMOOTH: it is a gradient, so
 * neighbouring pixels differ by a level or two. Geometry is what puts a STEP in
 * it, at every silhouette and every facet boundary. So "how much of this frame
 * is geometry" is answerable without knowing a single colour, which is what
 * makes this survive the next palette change as well as this one.
 *
 * The predicate it replaced a "blue-dominant" heuristic for is still worth
 * remembering: that one classified the building material `0xc8ccd8` as sky and
 * reported zero surface pixels while pointing straight at a row of buildings.
 * An edge count cannot make that mistake, because it never asks what colour
 * anything is.
 *
 * **The count is NOT a pixel area** — it is roughly a perimeter, so callers
 * comparing "with buildings" against "without" should compare orders of
 * magnitude or ratios, not absolute areas.
 *
 * `meanY` is the vertical centre of mass, 0 at the top of the canvas and 1 at the
 * bottom — which is how a test can tell "looking UP at the buildings from
 * underneath" from "looking down at them".

 * Waits until the scene stops repainting, and leaves that settled frame stashed.
 *
 * WHY A BASELINE HAS TO BE SETTLED. Every layer test here works the same way:
 * stash a frame with the layer off, switch it on, assert a large difference,
 * switch it off, assert the difference goes away. That last assertion is only
 * meaningful if NOTHING ELSE changed the picture in between — and plenty can. The
 * terrain load, a progressive scoring ring and the layer's own repaint all land on
 * their own schedule, so a baseline captured a moment too early is a baseline of a
 * scene that was still arriving, and the difference never returns to zero.
 *
 * Observed exactly that way: the roads step held at 8100 differing pixels against
 * a `< 3000` floor for the full 15 s timeout, in a serial run, with the layer
 * correctly off. Two tests in the demo spec had already grown their own private
 * version of this wait ("wait for the scene to settle, or the startup terrain
 * frame is what gets compared") — this is that pattern, once, where the probe it
 * depends on already lives.
 *
 * Convergence is THREE identical consecutive frames, re-stashing each round: the
 * first round has no stash and reports `-1`, and the loop ends holding the frame
 * that proved itself stable, which is exactly the baseline the caller wants.
 *
 * THREE, NOT TWO, and the difference is a bug this had when it was written. The
 * scene renders ON DEMAND (DEC-R3-9), so a layer switch schedules a frame rather
 * than drawing one — and two reads taken before that frame is presented are
 * identical, so the wait "converged" on the picture from BEFORE the change and
 * stashed it. The caller then switched the layer back on and measured no
 * difference at all: `> 3000` against a received 0, held for the full timeout.
 *
 * This is a settle, not a barrier. It cannot know which change it is waiting
 * for, so a caller that has an app-level signal for the change — the status line
 * dropping a layer's counter, say — should assert THAT first and use this to
 * absorb what follows.

 * straight back — a reload IS the boot. So state has to be undone in place.
 *
 * WHY `beforeEach` AND NOT PER-TEST TEARDOWN (DEC-S6). This runs even when the
 * previous test FAILED, which is exactly when the page is dirtiest and when
 * per-test cleanup is least likely to have run. One failing test must not
 * cascade into unrelated ones.
 *
 * WHY EVERY STEP IS CONDITIONAL (DEC-S8). Two of these controls trigger a
 * refetch: re-checking `cells` goes through `layersNeedingData`, and a category
 * change re-runs the whole pipeline. Resetting unconditionally would cost a
 * scoring cycle per test and give back the exact boot the shared page saves, so
 * the common case — nothing moved — has to be a few cheap reads and no clicks.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY CANNOT RESET, and why those tests keep their own page
 * rather than being worked around here:
 *
 * - **A different network stub.** `stubNetwork(page, { overpassStatus: 400 })`
 *   is installed at boot; a page stubbed to succeed cannot be talked into
 *   failing afterwards.
 * - **Cells OFF.** The in-progress test exists to watch the cell FETCH happen,
 *   which cannot be observed on a page where the cells are already held.
 *
 * The geo-event marker USED to be on that list — "there is no control that
 * removes it" (#271 review). W6 added one, so it is reset below like anything
 * else. Note what it took: a store action (W2) AND a control, because this
 * helper can only press things.
