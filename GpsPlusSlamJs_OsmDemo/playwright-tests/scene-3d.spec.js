      //   material as shipped (roughness 0.42, flatShading)  SD = 2.51

      // The two are indistinguishable. The reason is geometric rather than a
      // material-tuning problem: Cologne's relief is about +/-25 m across a 2.8 km
      // plane, so adjacent facets differ by well under a degree, and a roughness
      // 0.42 lobe is far too broad to resolve that. The cue is not weak here, it is

/**

 *
 * TWO CLAIMS, AND THE SECOND IS THE IMPORTANT ONE.
 *
 * The first is that the hotkey reaches the sun at all. `setTimeOfDay` is unit
 * tested and `sunAt` is unit tested, but nothing until now connected a keypress
 * to a repaint — and a control that exists in the class and not on the page is
 * the exact shape of "the data is right and the picture never changed".
 *
 * The second is DEC-R4-5: **the affordance heat ramp must stay the loudest thing
 * on screen.** Round 6 pushes on that from four directions at once — ACES
 * re-maps every colour, the environment map lifts every surface, §2 will tint
 * the ground and §6 will multiply the grid's share of the frame by six. Until
 * now that constraint has been enforced by looking at screenshots, which means
 * it has never actually been enforced. This is the durable form of it.

      //
      // WHY IT WAS NOT MEASURED AGAINST THE DEFAULT, originally, and the reason
      // is a finding rather than a convenience: run against round 5's default —
      // the height ramp (DEC-R5-4) — switching the cells ON *reduces* mean frame
      // chroma by 0.05. The ramp is a deliberately loud blue-to-white scale with
      // magenta for missing DEM, and it out-saturates the data layer DEC-R4-5
      // says must be loudest. **That constraint was ALREADY breached, by the
      // diagnostic, before round 6 touched anything** — which is direct evidence
      // for DEC-R6-5 demoting the ramp to a mode.
      //
      // THE HOLE THAT LEFT, AND WHY IT IS NOT ALLOWED BACK. The original carried
      // a comment promising "when §2 lands, the default ground becomes the one
      // measured here". §2 landed and made the default `cpu-slope`, not `cpu`,
      // so for one round the only durable defence of DEC-R4-5 measured a
      // configuration nobody sees. The slope treatment adds an aspect tint,
      // isoclines and a rim light, all of which put chroma into the backdrop.
      // A promise about a future default cannot live in a comment; it has to be
      // an assertion, so both modes are now named and a future default change
      // that breaks the constraint goes red instead of quietly stepping outside
      // the measurement.
      //
      // The default is spelled as a LITERAL, matching the rest of this suite,
      // and it is not floating free: `ground-mode.test.ts` pins
      // `DEFAULT_GROUND_MODE`, and the ground-mode picker spec above asserts the
      // control boots showing `cpu-slope`. A default change that missed this
      // line would fail there first.

      // palette or ground-appearance change ever made the backdrop as colourful
      // as the data, this goes red — which is the whole point, because that is
      // the moment DEC-R4-5 is breached and it is otherwise invisible.
      //
      // MEASURED, by mutating each bound to an unreachable value and reading
      // what came back — an assertion nobody has watched fail is worth nothing,
      // and this suite has already shipped one vacuous test (§14.5's isocline
      // check, which asserted a constant against an argument it never took):
      //
      //   plain `cpu`   -> 9.285
      //   `cpu-slope`   -> 9.302  (the default)
      //
      // **The two agree to within 0.02, and that is the honest reading of F49:
      // the gate WAS sound at the default — by accident.** The aspect tint is
      // blended proportionally to steepness and the fixture site (Cologne) is
      // nearly flat, so the slope treatment puts almost no chroma into the
      // backdrop HERE. On a site with real relief, or after a default change, it
      // need not be. The second assertion costs one more measurement and removes
      // the accident; it is not carrying its weight in this number today, and
      // that is fine — it is carrying it against the change nobody has made yet.
      //
      // The bound of 5 therefore sits at ~54 % of the observed margin in both.
      //
      // **The wrong response to a red here is lowering the margin.** It is
      // either fixing the backdrop or re-judging the decision that made it the
      // default (DEC-R6-5 for `cpu-slope`), which is exactly the call the ramp
      // measurement above already forced once.
