/**
 * ONE BOOT FOR THIS WHOLE FILE (DEC-S5), instead of one per test.
 *
 * The boot — `stubNetwork` → `goto` → `waitForRefresh` through three
 * progressive scoring rings — was measured at ~74% of the entire e2e suite's
 * work, and it was being paid once per test to assert things about a map that
 * had not changed. Seven of this file's ten tests share this page; each is
 * returned to the baseline by `resetUi` rather than by a reload, because a
 * reload IS the boot.
 *
 * THE BASELINE IS WHATEVER THE BOOT PRODUCED — captured, never imposed. The
 * first version forced the cells ON, reasoning that five of the seven tests
 * enable them anyway and would then skip a refetch. It cost more than it saved:
 * the reset re-checked a layer the previous test had switched off, only for the
 * next test to switch it off again, and that off/on/off churn — which no
 * per-test boot ever performs — broke a 3D region pick that passed in isolation
 * and failed after its predecessor. Restoring to the captured default makes the
 * common case a genuine no-op.
 *
 * FOUR TESTS ARE NOT HERE and take Playwright's own `{ page }` fixture. Three
 * are known limitations `resetUi` cannot fix — a different network stub, a fetch
 * that can only be watched from cells-OFF, and a geo-event marker with no
 * control that removes it; `fixtures.js` records each next to `resetUi`. The
 * fourth is an unexplained 3D-raycast interaction, documented at the test.

      // Something resizes the map pane by ~42 px shortly after the marker is
      // drawn (the status line's own text changes as the search completes).
      // Leaflet's cached size is briefly stale, `map-view.ts`'s ResizeObserver
      // corrects it, and the correction lands WITHIN ONE FRAME. Provoked
      // directly: growing `#map` by 42 px and reading with **zero** wait gives
      // **21.172 px**; reading 16 ms later gives **0.172 px**. 21.172 is exactly
      // half the height delta plus the settled offset, and it is the
      // bit-identical value every failing run reported.
      //
      // So the app converges and the test did not wait for it. Under load the
      // sub-frame window widens until a single read lands inside it, which is
      // why this failed on a busy machine and passed on a quiet one — and why
      // two earlier investigations, both reasoning from one sample, concluded
      // "deterministic" and "stale cache" respectively. Neither survived.
      //
      // THE BOUND IS UNCHANGED AT 8 px. This waits for the state the bound
      // describes; it does not widen the bound to admit a state the app is
      // leaving. A genuine regression — the 61 px one this replaced — never
      // settles, so the poll times out and fails exactly as before.
