/**
 * ONE BOOT FOR THIS WHOLE FILE (DEC-S5), instead of one per test.
 *
 * The boot — `stubNetwork` → `goto` → `waitForRefresh` through three
 * progressive scoring rings — was measured at ~74% of the entire e2e suite's
 * work, and it was being paid once per test to assert things about a map that
 * had not changed. Seven of this file's ten tests share this page; each is
 * returned to the baseline by `resetUi` rather than by a reload, because a
 * reload IS the boot.
 *
 * THE BASELINE IS WHATEVER THE BOOT PRODUCED — captured, never imposed. The
 * first version forced the cells ON, reasoning that five of the seven tests
 * enable them anyway and would then skip a refetch. It cost more than it saved:
 * the reset re-checked a layer the previous test had switched off, only for the
 * next test to switch it off again, and that off/on/off churn — which no
 * per-test boot ever performs — broke a 3D region pick that passed in isolation
 * and failed after its predecessor. Restoring to the captured default makes the
 * common case a genuine no-op.
 *
 * FOUR TESTS ARE NOT HERE and take Playwright's own `{ page }` fixture. Three
 * are known limitations `resetUi` cannot fix — a different network stub, a fetch
 * that can only be watched from cells-OFF, and a geo-event marker with no
 * control that removes it; `fixtures.js` records each next to `resetUi`. The
 * fourth is an unexplained 3D-raycast interaction, documented at the test.
