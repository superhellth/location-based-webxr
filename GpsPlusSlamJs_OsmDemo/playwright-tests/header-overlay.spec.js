/**
 * Q11 — the header floats over the views instead of taking a row from them.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A GEOMETRY TEST AND NOT A DOM TEST. The field report is that the
 * 3D view has too little height on a phone, and `header-collapse.ts` records why
 * that is literally true: `body` is `grid-template-rows: auto 1fr`, so the header
 * is a ROW whose height is taken out of `main` rather than covering it. A test on
 * class names or DOM order cannot tell the two layouts apart — both have the same
 * markup — so every assertion here is on measured boxes.
 *
 * That same docblock recorded overlay-versus-collapse as a deliberate either/or
 * and took collapse. This milestone takes the other one, on the owner's request,
 * which is why the collapse tests still exist and still pass: the header can
 * float AND collapse, it just no longer hands viewport back when it does.
