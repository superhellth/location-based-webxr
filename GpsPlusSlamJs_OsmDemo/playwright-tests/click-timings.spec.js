/**
 * The click-path breakdown, end to end in a real browser with a real worker.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT ANSWER — read before quoting a number from it.
 *
 * **It does NOT answer the owner's question.** The plan's §0.3 item 3 is
 * explicit: the deliverable is a ranked breakdown of a REAL click over REAL
 * cached tiles, and substituting a fixture-driven harness "is precisely what
 * produced the gap" the plan exists to close. This suite is hostname-blocked
 * from Overpass by design, so the fetch stages here are a 242-feature fixture,
 * i.e. ~0.2–0.6 % of a res-7 tile. **Any ranking read off this run is a
 * ranking of the wrong input.**
 *
 * **What it DOES answer is the thing unit tests structurally cannot: does the
 * instrument compose across the worker boundary in a real browser.** Every
 * cross-boundary risk in the design is live here and nowhere else —
 *
 *  - a real dedicated worker with its own `performance.timeOrigin`, which is
 *    why stage 8 is derived rather than timestamped across the boundary;
 *  - a real structured clone of the snapshot, carrying `timings` and
 *    `workerTimings` as plain data;
 *  - the real three-pass widening, so the per-ring tagging is exercised;
 *  - and the real reconciliation, against a wall clock the page measures.
 *
 * A unit test can assert the arithmetic. Only this can assert that the numbers
 * survive the trip and add up on the other side.
