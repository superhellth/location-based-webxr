  // "takes 15-30 fixes to express a change" (37 characters, ASCII hyphen)
  // against the production string OF THAT DAY, "takes ~15–30 fixes to express"
  // (29, en dash). The layout question this fixture exists to answer is whether
  // the real CSS fits the real strings, and a replica that is eight characters
  // too long answers a different question. J5 was about to widen that gap by
  // editing the copy by hand — the exact drift the spec's own comment warned
  // about.
  //
  // BOTH OF THOSE STRINGS ARE NOW HISTORY, which is the point: J5 shortened
  // production again in this same branch, to "~15–30 fixes to show" (20). A
  // replica would have needed a third hand-edit to keep up. This fixture did
  // not, because it renders whatever `ar-compass-control.ts` renders.
  //
  // MOUNTED BY DYNAMIC IMPORT OF THE SOURCE MODULE, which needs NO
  // production-visible export: the e2e runs against the Vite DEV server (see
  // `playwright.config.js`'s `webServer`), so `/src/*.ts` is served and
  // importable from the page. That is the whole reason DEC-J12's stop condition
  // ("if it needs an export purely for a test, stop") was never reached.
  //
  // ⚠️ IT COUPLES THIS FIXTURE TO THE DEV SERVER. Pointed at a built preview,
  // the import 404s and this throws — loudly, which is the right failure: a
  // silent fallback to a replica is what this replaces.
  //
  // AND IT COSTS A KNIP ENTRY: `/src/...` is not node-resolvable from this
  // file, so the root `check:deadcode` stage fails on it without the
  // `ignoreUnresolved` line in the repo-root `knip.json` (reasoning in

     * "Der Settings Button funktioniert immer noch nicht" and "das wird halt
     * gar nicht ein/ausgeblendet, das ist immer sichtbar" — reported twice,
     * two branches apart.
     *
     * THE CAUSE IS A CSS CASCADE RULE, not an event problem, and that matters
     * because two rounds of diagnosis went looking in the wrong place.
     * `ar-experiment-panel.ts` opens and closes by writing `body.hidden`, which
     * takes effect through the USER-AGENT stylesheet's `[hidden] { display:
     * none }`. `.ar-experiments` sets `display: flex` in the AUTHOR stylesheet,
     * and author rules beat user-agent rules whatever their specificity. So
     * `hidden` did nothing at all: the panel was permanently visible, and the
     * gear toggled a flag with no visual effect — which is exactly what a dead
     * button looks like.
     *
     * ONE CAUSE, BOTH SYMPTOMS. The plan's DEC-Y16 argued they had to be two
     * independent failures, reasoning that a panel which mounts CLOSED cannot
     * be reported as permanently VISIBLE by a broken toggle. The premise was
     * right and the conclusion was wrong, because the panel never actually
     * mounted closed on screen — only in the DOM.
     *
     * jsdom cannot see this (no stylesheet, no cascade) and the unit test that
     * asserts `body.hidden` passes against the defect, which is why this one is
     * an e2e measuring `display` rather than the attribute.
