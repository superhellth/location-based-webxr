/**
 * Curated re-export surface of `gps-plus-slam-js` (the closed-source core
 * library) for app consumers of `gps-plus-slam-app-framework`.
 *
 * Apps should import core symbols from here rather than from `gps-plus-slam-js`
 * directly so that:
 *   - Apps need only one direct npm dependency (the framework). The core is
 *     declared as a `peerDependency` of the framework and auto-installed by
 *     pnpm — see 2026-05-01-app-single-package-dep-analysis.md (Option C).
 *   - The framework can curate which core symbols are part of the public app
 *     surface, providing a real architectural boundary.
 *   - Coordinated releases only need to update the framework's peer-dep range,
 *     not pin sites scattered across every app `package.json`.
 *
 * Library-only consumers (no framework) can still depend on `gps-plus-slam-js`
 * directly; this barrel does not replace it.
 *
 * NOTE on `RootState`: the library exports a type named `RootState` that
 * refers to the *core* store's state shape. The framework also exports a
 * `RootState` that refers to the *framework* (recorder) store's state shape.
 * To avoid a name collision we re-export the library's type as both
 * `RootState` (here, in this dedicated namespace) and as `LibraryRootState`
 * (a convenience alias for tests that want to disambiguate at the import
 * site). Import as:
 *
 *   import { type LibraryRootState } from 'gps-plus-slam-app-framework/core';
