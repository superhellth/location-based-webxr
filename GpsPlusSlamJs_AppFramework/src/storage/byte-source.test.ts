/**
 * Why these tests matter: the whole remote→local switch reduces to one
 * guarantee — a read that started before the switch must finish from the
 * source it started on, and only new reads see the new source. A consumer
 * (e.g. a zip.js Reader) holds a single instance for an archive's whole
 * lifetime and never learns the bytes moved from a Range fetch to a local
 * cache; that illusion is this class. The in-flight test below is the one
 * that actually protects a caller mid-fetch when a background download lands.
