/**
 * The swappable byte-source seam behind range-based ZIP streaming.
 *
 * A `ByteSource` is random-access over one archive: "give me bytes
 * [offset, offset+length)". A zip.js `Reader` (see `zip-byte-source-reader.ts`)
 * reads an archive's whole lifetime through a single instance of one of these;
 * the reader never learns whether the bytes came from an HTTP Range fetch or a
 * local cache. That indirection is what lets a consumer swap remote→local
 * mid-session.
 *
 * `SwitchableByteSource` holds the *current* source and flips it atomically
 * once, e.g. after a background download has warmed a local copy.
