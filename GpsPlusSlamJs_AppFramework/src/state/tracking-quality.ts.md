# tracking-quality.ts

## Purpose

Phase A of the tracking-quality / GPS↔SLAM convergence reporter described in
[docs/2026-05-16-tracking-quality-metrics-plan.md](../../../../../gps-plus-slam/GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-05-16-tracking-quality-metrics-plan.md).
Computes a single `TrackingQualityReport` from already-public Redux state
(`gpsData`, `tracking`, `recording`) plus a small auxiliary slice
(`trackingQuality`) that buffers the last N alignment matrices.

Five sub-scores, each in `[0, 1]`, gate a single overall `confidence` value
(`min(...)`):

- **convergence** (§4.1) — how stable consecutive alignment matrices are.
- **residualConsensus** (§4.2) — agreement between odometry-projected pose and
  GPS fixes, normalised by `latLongAccuracy`.
- **compassAgreement** (§4.3) — bearing the alignment claims vs. the absolute
  compass reading (skipped when `absolute !== true`).
- **gpsAccuracy** (§4.4) — median reported `latLongAccuracy` over the recent
  K samples.
- **coverage** (§4.5) — combination of walked distance and direction spread.

Each sub-score is exposed alongside human-readable diagnostics. A coarse
state machine collapses the score to `'warming-up' | 'ar-lost' | 'degraded' |
'ok'`.

## Public API

- **Functions**
  - `computeTrackingQualityReport(state, options?)` — pure aggregator over the
    base `SlamAppRootState` (extended with `trackingQuality`).
  - `computeConvergence(snapshots, options?)` / `matrixDelta(a, b)` — §4.1.
  - `computeResidualConsensus(matrix, gps, odom, zeroRef, options?)` — §4.2.
  - `computeCompassAgreement(matrix, sensorOrientation, arPose, options?)` —
    §4.3.
  - `computeGpsAccuracy(gpsPoints, options?)` — §4.4.
  - `computeCoverage(odomPositions, options?)` — §4.5.
  - `computeGpsVsFusedDivergence(...)` — §4.6 diagnostic only.
  - `createTrackingQualityListenerMiddleware(options?)` — Redux listener that
    buffers alignment matrices and recomputes the report on relevant actions.
- **Reducer / actions**
  - `trackingQualityReducer`.
  - `snapshotPushed(AlignmentSnapshot)`, `snapshotsTrimmed({size})`,
    `reportUpdated(report | null)`, `firstAgreementReached(observationIndex)`,
    `degradedCountUpdated(count)`, `resetTrackingQuality()`.
- **Selectors**
  - `selectTrackingQuality(state)`, `selectRecentAlignments(state)`,
    `selectFirstAgreementObservationIndex(state)`.
- **Constants / types**
  - `DEFAULT_TRACKING_QUALITY_OPTIONS` (corpus-derived values from the §6.1
    parameter sweep — see plan §11 (c)/(d); locked by a regression test).
  - `TrackingQualityState`, `TrackingQualityReport`, `TrackingQualityOptions`,
    `AlignmentSnapshot`, `TrackingQualitySliceState`,
    `ConvergenceResult`, `ResidualConsensusResult`, `GpsAccuracyResult`,
    `CoverageResult`, `CompassAgreementResult`.

All inputs are treated as **readonly**. Helpers never mutate arrays they
receive — copies are taken before sorting or sliding-window operations.

## Invariants & assumptions

- `Matrix4` is column-major (per `fusedGpsFromOdom` in `gps-plus-slam-js`).
- `Vector3` uses the library's NUE convention: `[north, up, east]` (metres).
  Coverage / bearing math reads `[0]` as north and `[2]` as east; up is
  ignored.
- The reported AR-forward axis is the GL-camera convention `(0, 0, -1)`. This
  matches the camera-quaternion rotation produced by WebXR and by
  `recordGpsEvent`'s synthetic pose.
- Listener middleware **defends against missing slice state** (`state.trackingQuality?`)
  so it stays usable in tests/stores that only mount a subset of slices.
- Listener middleware uses **shallow change detection** — `reportUpdated` is
  only dispatched when the freshly-computed report differs from the previously
  cached one (using `reportsEqual`).
- Reset triggers (`recording/startSession`, `tracking/resetTracking`) clear
  both the matrix buffer, the cached report, and the `degradedConsecutiveCount`.
- Compass score returns `null` (and is excluded from `min`) when the device
  doesn't report an absolute heading. This is by design — magnetometers on
  iOS report `absolute === false` until a calibration succeeds.
- `compassDriftDetected` only fires after the first-agreement detector has
  established that compass and alignment once agreed (convergence high +
  heading ≤ warn threshold for `firstAgreementMinStreak` consecutive
  observations). Before first agreement, it is always `false`.
- §4.8 hysteresis: the `ok → degraded` transition is held off for
  `degradedHoldoff` (default 3) consecutive sub-threshold observations.
  `degraded → ok` is immediate. `ar-lost` bypasses holdoff entirely.
- All sub-scores are clamped to `[0, 1]`; never `NaN` for empty input.

## Defensive measures

- `matrixDelta` validates length-16 matrices and returns zero deltas otherwise.
  Internally uses `mat4.getRotation` + `quat.getAngle` + `mat4.getTranslation`
  from gl-matrix — the same kernel as `computeStabilityDelta` in
  `GpsPlusSlamJs_Investigation/src/investigation-helpers.ts`. Per the plan
  §11 (a), these two functions share one numeric definition so the §6.1
  corpus sweep's correlations are computed against the same kernel the
  AppFramework reports at runtime. Numerical agreement is locked in by the
  "matches the gl-matrix quat-based reference kernel" tests.
- `computeResidualConsensus` returns score 0 (and `null` median) when alignment
  matrix or zero reference is missing.
- `computeGpsAccuracy` skips entries with non-finite `latLongAccuracy`.
- `computeCoverage` handles zero or one odom samples and pure stand-still loops.
- `computeCompassAgreement` returns all-null fields when the sensor isn't
  absolute, the alignment matrix is missing, or the AR pose is unavailable.

## Examples

```ts
import {
  createTrackingQualityListenerMiddleware,
  trackingQualityReducer,
  selectTrackingQuality,
} from 'gps-plus-slam-app-framework';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: { /* ... */, trackingQuality: trackingQualityReducer },
  middleware: (gdm) =>
    gdm({ serializableCheck: false }).prepend(
      createTrackingQualityListenerMiddleware()
    ),
});

store.subscribe(() => {
  const report = selectTrackingQuality(store.getState());
  if (report?.state === 'ok') console.log('confidence:', report.confidence);
});
```

## Tests

- Co-located unit tests: [tracking-quality.test.ts](tracking-quality.test.ts) —
  53 tests covering pure helpers, slice reducers, the aggregator
  state-machine, anti-validation cases from plan §6, the listener
  middleware contract, corpus-derived defaults regression (§11 (d)),
  compassDriftDetected / first-agreement detector (§11 (e)), and
  §4.8 hysteresis (§11 (f)).
- Investigation sweep (Phase A (c)): `GpsPlusSlamJs_Investigation/src/investigations/tracking-quality.test.ts`
  — 5 tests replaying the full `TestDataJs/` corpus (§6.1 sweep,
  compass perturbation, anti-validation).
