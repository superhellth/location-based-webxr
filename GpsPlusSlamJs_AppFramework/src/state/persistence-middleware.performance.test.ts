/**
 * Performance guard for persistence middleware synchronous overhead.
 *
 * Why this test matters: The persistence middleware runs on EVERY Redux
 * dispatch during recording. Its synchronous path (action type checks,
 * recording state checks, index increment, WriteQueue enqueue) must not
 * add perceptible latency to the dispatch cycle, and — critically — it
 * must stay O(1) per dispatch. The actual async OPFS writes are
 * non-blocking and not measured here.
 *
 * How it asserts that (and why it is NOT a wall-clock budget):
 *
 * The previous version compared a single per-dispatch wall-clock sample
 * against a hard 0.1 ms threshold. That is inherently flaky — the same
 * code is "correct" at 0.099 ms and "broken" at 0.101 ms purely from
 * scheduler noise, GC, and whatever else the full suite runs concurrently
 * (see GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-06-15-followup-flaky-persistence-perf-test.md).
 *
 * Instead we assert the *algorithmic invariant* the test actually cares
 * about: per-dispatch cost does not grow with the number of dispatches in
 * a burst. We measure the median per-dispatch time for a small burst and a
 * much larger burst (20×) and assert the ratio stays below a generous
 * factor. O(1) work yields a ratio near 1; an accidental O(n) regression
 * in the hot path (e.g. scanning the growing WriteQueue on each enqueue)
 * would balloon the large-burst figure and trip the assertion. Because both
 * figures scale together with machine speed, the ratio is robust to load.
 *
 * A very generous absolute ceiling (far above observed ~0.01 ms) is kept
 * only as a backstop against a catastrophic regression, not as the primary
 * signal.
