/**
 * `createSlamAppStore` — composable Redux store factory for AR+GPS apps.
 *
 * Introduced in Iter 1 of the AppFramework/RecorderApp boundary migration.
 * Wires the three library reducers (`gpsData`, `gpsElements`, `arElements`),
 * the framework's recording lifecycle slice, and the persistence middleware.
 *
 * Recorder-only state (routing screen, ref-points, scenario) is plugged in
 * by the consumer via `extraReducers` / `extraMiddleware`. The factory itself
 * never references those concepts so apps that don't need them (POI viewers,
 * navigation arrows, …) compose freely.
 *
 * This is the framework's ONLY store factory (the legacy
 * `createRecorderStore`/`store.ts` it replaced moved out in Iter 1D); the
 * core library's license error messages point here as the remediation.

  // `enableCompassColdStartOverride: false` silently began meaning **ON** for every
  // consumer that opted out — three of them in this repo, and the live recording
  // case is the worst:
  //  - **Recording (worse).** A calibration capture, whose whole point is to record
  //    unmodified compass behaviour, would have run WITH the override active while
  //    the operator had switched it off — and the recording carries no action
  //    saying so either way. That is corrupt data, not a misreading of good data.
  //  - **Replay.** `replay-mode.ts` passes the same `false` to stop a session
  //    captured without the override from replaying with one; that stopped working,
  //    so a correct recording was replayed wrongly.
  //  - **`AnchorStarter`'s `?coldStartOverride=0`**, the documented no-rebuild
  //    opt-out for field testers, also became inert. No recording there
  //    (`NullStorageBackend`), so the effect was confined to the live session.
  // `recordWhenFalse` fixes all three, since the live store dispatches the `false`
  // too — the option reaches the library rather than only suppressing a dispatch.
  // The tests missed it because the assertion was `toBeFalsy()`, which `undefined`
  // satisfies.
  //
  // Why only the cold-start row carries `recordWhenFalse` rather than all five:
  // recording every flag unconditionally would add four no-op actions to EVERY
  // recording (measured: a minimal session went from 1 opt-in action to 5) to fix
  // one flag. The other four are debug/experiment flags whose library default is
  // `false`, so for them "absent ⇒ off" is a stable contract. The rule to apply
  // when that changes is written on the `recordWhenFalse` field above: any flag
  // whose library default stops being `false` needs it.
  // `isSet` asks "has this flag been DECIDED yet?", not "does it equal my
  // option?", and the distinction is the whole replay contract.
  //
  // The listener's predicate is edge-triggered on the `gpsData` OBJECT REFERENCE,
  // and every library reducer mutation produces a fresh one. So an `isSet` of the
  // form `flag === enabled` turns the listener into a value ENFORCER: a replayed
  // `setColdStartOverrideEnabled(true)` re-arms the predicate, the effect sees
  // `true !== false`, and it dispatches `false` straight over the recorded value.
  // A session recorded WITH the override would then replay WITHOUT one — the same
  // defect this whole change exists to fix, merely inverted.
  //
  // `!== undefined` gives the right semantics in one line: the framework supplies
  // the INITIAL value, and anything the action stream (or any later explicit
  // dispatch) decides wins. It also preserves the 2026-06-27 field-bug fix, since
