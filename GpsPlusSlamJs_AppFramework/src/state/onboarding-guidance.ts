/**
 * Onboarding-guidance seam — turns a {@link TrackingQualityReport} into a
 * compact, user-facing "what should I do next?" instruction for first-time
 * AR+GPS users.
 *
 * Motivation & decisions: see
 * `gps-plus-slam/GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-05-31-student-onboarding-anchor-example-user-feedback.md`
 * (Finding 3 + decision D3 → option C2). The recorder HUD
 * ({@link https} `updateTrackingQuality` in the recorder's `hud.ts`) is an
 * expert diagnostics panel; this seam is its onboarding-flavoured sibling
 * that coaches a user to *move around until alignment is good enough*.
 *
 * Pure-function discipline — `computeOnboardingGuidance` is a pure function
 * over a `TrackingQualityReport | null`. It does not read the Redux store,
 * so it is trivially testable on crafted reports and composes directly with
 * the nullable output of {@link selectTrackingQuality}. A thin store-bound
 * `selectOnboardingGuidance(state)` wrapper is provided for convenience.
