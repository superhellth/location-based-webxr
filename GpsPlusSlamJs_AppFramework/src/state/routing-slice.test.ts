/**
 * Tests for routingSlice — Redux state for application screen navigation.
 *
 * Why this test matters: Bug 2 (SPA architecture audit) — the navigation
 * module stored `currentScreen` as a module-level mutable variable
 * disconnected from Redux, causing desync on rapid transitions and
 * preventing time-travel debugging. This slice makes the current screen
 * part of the Redux store, the single source of truth.
 *
 * @see docs/2026-04-06-spa-architecture-audit.md — Bug 2
