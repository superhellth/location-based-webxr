# `slam-app-store-listener.ts`

## Purpose

Builds the listener middleware that applies the compass debug/experiment
**opt-in flags** (`coldStartOverrideEnabled`, `compassRotationPriorEnabled`,
`compassWebXRConsistencyEnabled`) once the library `gpsData` slice exists. It is
the structural replacement for the former `store.subscribe` +
`queueMicrotask` + `scheduled`-guard scaffolding in
[`create-slam-app-store.ts`](create-slam-app-store.ts), and mirrors the
established [`tracking-quality.ts`](tracking-quality.ts)
`createTrackingQualityListenerMiddleware` precedent.

## Why it exists (the ordering trap it removes)

The flags live on the `gpsData` slice, which is `null` until the first
`setZeroPos`, so we must dispatch a **follow-up** action in reaction to
`gpsData` appearing. Doing that from a raw `store.subscribe` listener dispatches
**synchronously inside** the trigger's `next()`, and the persistence middleware
([`persistence-middleware.ts`](persistence-middleware.ts)) assigns its replay
index _after_ `next()`. So the nested opt-in gets a **lower** index than the
`setZeroPos` that created `gpsData`, is recorded **before** its trigger, and is
dropped on replay (field bug 2026-06-27, recordings `64c6a294` / `e7431b85`).

A **prepended** listener-middleware effect runs **after** the triggering
dispatch unwinds, so `api.dispatch(...)` here is a top-level dispatch that the
persistence middleware indexes _after_ the trigger → correct replay order **by
construction**, with no `queueMicrotask` / re-entrancy guard to hand-maintain.

## Public API

- `createSlamAppStoreListenerMiddleware(optIns: readonly CompassOptIn[]): Middleware`
  — returns the RTK listener middleware. Register it via `.prepend(...)` in the
  store factory (prepend is required so the effect dispatches **outside** the
  trigger's `next()`).
- `CompassOptIn` — `{ isSet, apply }`:
  - `isSet(state: LibraryRootState): boolean` — whether the flag is already set.
  - `apply(dispatch): void` — dispatches the action that sets the flag
    (e.g. `dispatch(setColdStartOverrideEnabled(true))`). It receives a bound
    `dispatch` rather than closing over the store, so descriptors can be built
    **before** the store exists (the middleware is passed into `configureStore`).

## Invariants & assumptions

- **Predicate is level-based, not edge-based.** It fires whenever `gpsData` is
  non-null **and at least one opt-in is still unset** — _not_ on a `null →
non-null` transition. Keying on "a flag is unset" means a recreated `gpsData`
  (store swap / origin reset) with cleared flags re-triggers the apply, matching
  the pre-existing re-apply semantics (the 2026-06-27 field bug). **Do not
  "simplify" it to a transition predicate** — that silently drops the re-apply.
- **Idempotent under re-entrancy.** `isSet` is re-read against the _current_
  store state immediately before each dispatch (not one snapshot at effect
  entry). Redux dispatch is synchronous, so a flag is set before the next check
  runs, and an opt-in's own dispatch re-triggers the predicate (which can
  re-enter the effect) — re-checking per dispatch guarantees each flag is
  dispatched **exactly once** per `gpsData` creation (no "storm").
- **Effect dispatches are async** (RTK schedules listener effects after the
  trigger). Tests must `await` (a microtask / `setTimeout(0)`) before asserting.
- The factory only registers this middleware when `optIns.length > 0`, so the
  common path keeps zero per-action predicate overhead.

## Examples

```ts
import { createSlamAppStoreListenerMiddleware } from './slam-app-store-listener';
import { setColdStartOverrideEnabled } from 'gps-plus-slam-js';

const listener = createSlamAppStoreListenerMiddleware([
  {
    isSet: (s) => s.gpsData?.coldStartOverrideEnabled === true,
    apply: (dispatch) => dispatch(setColdStartOverrideEnabled(true)),
  },
]);

// In configureStore: getDefaultMiddleware().prepend(listener).concat(persistence)
```

## Tests

Covered by [slam-app-store-listener.test.ts](slam-app-store-listener.test.ts):

- Dispatches the opt-in **exactly once**, **after** the trigger (ordering proof
  via an appended action-logging middleware).
- Dispatches every requested opt-in once when several are enabled.
- **Re-applies** the opt-in when `gpsData` is recreated (store-swap / origin
  reset, modelled with a root reducer that resets `gpsData` to `null`).
- Does nothing when no opt-in is requested, and does not fire before `gpsData`
  exists.

The end-to-end recording-fidelity invariant (opt-in persisted **after**
`setZeroPos`, each flag exactly once) is pinned in the RecorderApp's
`recorder-store.test.ts` "persists the compass opt-in AFTER setZeroPos".
