/**
 * `qrDetected` Redux slice — Note 3 of the QR-tracking follow-up plan
 * (docs `2026-06-15-followup-qr-tracking-generalization-overlay-and-north.md`).
 *
 * A detection-agnostic, framework-level store of "what was detected, where, in
 * 3D" that overlay / trigger / anchor consumers subscribe to INDEPENDENTLY of
 * the GPS fusion. The QR-tracking controller dispatches into it on every lock
 * (alongside, or instead of, the synthetic GPS vote — the vote is optional, the
 * `qrDetected` emission is not). Both the QR-tracking demo and the Recorder
 * consume the SAME slice — it is not duplicated per app and does NOT live in the
 * closed-source fusion core (locked maintainer decision, 2026-06-15 interview).
 *
 * Shape (locked decision): a dictionary keyed by the decoded payload (text/URL),
 * value = a per-marker BOUNDED RING BUFFER of detections + a size-lifecycle
 * estimate. Identity is the payload itself (already unique, human-debuggable) —
 * two physically-distinct markers sharing a payload merge by design, and a
 * *moving* marker with one payload accumulates a motion path (also desired).
 * The ring buffer is bounded by {@link QrDetectedState.maxHistory} so a naive
 * consumer cannot leak; `pruneQrDetections` is the explicit custom-cleanup path.
 *
 * Detection-agnostic on purpose (Note 1): the same shape (world pose + label +
 * confidence + timestamp) generalizes to future object detection (YOLO etc.),
 * so the fields are deliberately not QR-specific beyond the payload key.
 *
 * This slice is OPT-IN: apps wire it via `createSlamAppStore({ extraReducers:
 * { qrDetected: qrDetectedReducer } })`. It is not a built-in of the store
 * factory, so framework consumers that never detect anything pay nothing.
 *
 * @see ../ar/qr-tracking-controller.ts — the producer (dispatches `recordQrDetection`).
 * @see ../ar/qr-pose.ts — `Pose` / `QrPoseSolution` (the per-detection geometry).
