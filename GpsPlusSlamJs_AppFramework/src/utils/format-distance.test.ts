/**
 * Why these tests matter: this replaces three separate formatters that were
 * each read by a user in a different place. The tests are written as
 * DIFFERENTIAL checks against those three — the exact strings each one used to
 * produce — so "the unification changed nothing on screen" is a claim the suite
 * makes rather than one the commit message asserts.
 *
 * **The differential loops sample non-negative finite values only, and that is
 * the honest scope of the claim.** Outside it the output DID change on purpose:
 * two of the three used to print `"NaN m"`, and one used to print a negative
 * distance. Those cases are asserted separately, as the new contract rather
 * than as parity.
 *
 * The rest pin the parts that WERE unified: the kilometre boundary, rounding,
 * and what happens to a value that should not exist.
 *
 * @see format-distance.ts.md
