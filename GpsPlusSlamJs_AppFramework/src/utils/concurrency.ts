/**
 * Run an async worker over each item with a concurrency cap, invoking the worker
 * per item as the pool pulls it (rather than collecting results into an array).
 *
 * Unlike {@link mapWithConcurrencyLimit}, this returns no values — the worker is
 * expected to produce its side effect (e.g. emit a streaming callback) itself.
 * This is the shape progressive consumers need: each item is handled and can be
 * reported as soon as it settles, instead of waiting for the whole batch.
 *
 * Completion order is **not** guaranteed (it depends on which worker finishes
 * first). Each item's worker is invoked exactly once unless the run is aborted.
 *
 * When an `AbortSignal` is supplied, workers stop pulling **new** items as soon
 * as the signal is aborted (checked before each pull). Items already in flight
 * run to completion — the File System Access reads underneath cannot be torn
 * mid-read — but no further items are started, so a destroyed consumer stops
 * accumulating work. If the signal is already aborted, no work starts at all.
 *
 * @param items - Items to process
 * @param limit - Maximum number of concurrent worker invocations (`>= 1`)
 * @param worker - Async side-effecting function applied to each item
 * @param signal - Optional abort signal that halts pulling new items
 * @throws RangeError if `limit < 1`
 * @throws Re-throws the first error from any worker invocation (fail-fast)
