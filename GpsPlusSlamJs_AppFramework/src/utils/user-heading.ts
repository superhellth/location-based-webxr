/**
 * True-north user-heading kernel.
 *
 * Turns the latest AR camera rotation into an absolute compass bearing (degrees
 * clockwise from geographic North) so the live/replay map overlay can draw a
 * thin view-direction line from the user-position dot. See Finding 2 of
 * gps-plus-slam/GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-06-28-1822-map-rings-transparency-and-view-direction-user-feedback.md.
 *
 * Why this lives in the app-framework (NOT the library's `orientation-heading.ts`):
 * that library module is the MAGNETIC path — its bearings come from the
 * AbsoluteOrientationSensor's device→ENU quaternion and are explicitly magnetic
 * (they need WMM declination correction). Finding 2's locked source is the
 * GPS+SLAM **alignment matrix → true geographic north**, which rejects the
 * magnetic sensor. So the math belongs here, alongside `fused-path.ts`, which
 * already converts AR odometry through the same alignment matrix.
 *
 * Frame algebra (pinned by `user-heading.test.ts`):
 * - State stores odometry rotations as NUE quaternions
 *   (`webxrQuaternionToNUE(odomRotation)` in the library reducer). NUE means
 *   X=North, Y=Up, Z=East.
 * - A WebXR camera looks down its own −Z. The basis-change `webxrToNUE` maps
 *   that local forward `[0,0,-1]` to `[1,0,0]`, so the camera-forward basis
 *   vector in the NUE-AR frame is **[1, 0, 0]** (an identity camera looks North).
 * - The alignment matrix maps AR-NUE → world NUE metres (same matrix
 *   `computeFusedPath` applies to positions). Rotating the forward direction by
 *   it yields a world-NUE direction; the geographic bearing is
 *   `atan2(East, North)`.
 *
 * We rotate the *direction* and read the bearing directly rather than
 * round-tripping two points through `calcGpsCoords`: lat/lon scale North and
 * East by different metres-per-degree, so a naive GPS-coord bearing would be
 * anisotropically distorted. The aligned NUE metres already carry the true
 * bearing, so `atan2(East, North)` is both simpler and undistorted.
