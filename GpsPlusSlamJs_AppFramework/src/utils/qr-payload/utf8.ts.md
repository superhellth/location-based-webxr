# utf8.ts

## Purpose

UTF-8 encode/decode helpers shared by the QR payload codecs (benchmark plan
§6 P3). One shared fatal `TextDecoder` instead of per-call construction.

## Public API

- `utf8Encode(text: string) → Uint8Array`
- `utf8DecodeTotal(bytes: Uint8Array) → string | null` — **total**: invalid
  sequences yield `null` (fatal decoder, exception swallowed), never a
  lossy U+FFFD substitution — a silently mangled payload is worse than a
  rejected one.

## Invariants & assumptions

- The shared `TextDecoder` is safe to reuse: non-streaming `decode()` calls
  keep no state between invocations.
- **Lossless round-trip:** `utf8DecodeTotal(utf8Encode(s)) === s` for every
  valid Unicode string, including a leading U+FEFF — the decoder sets
  `ignoreBOM: true` because the default silently strips a leading BOM
  (PR #163 review fix, 2026-07-06).

## Examples

```ts
utf8DecodeTotal(utf8Encode('Zürich')); // 'Zürich'
utf8DecodeTotal(new Uint8Array([0xff])); // null
```

## Tests

- `utf8.test.ts` — direct unit + property coverage: multi-byte round-trips,
  the leading-BOM losslessness regression, invalid-sequence `null` paths.
- Also covered through the codec suites (`codec-dictionary.test.ts`,
  `codec-binary-anchor.test.ts`, `codecs.property.test.ts`) — every
  decode-total property exercises both paths.
