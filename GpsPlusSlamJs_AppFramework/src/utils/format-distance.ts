/**
 * The workspace's one distance formatter.
 *
 * WHY IT IS SHARED AT ALL. Three packages formatted the same quantity for the
 * same user with three different rules — `1234.5 m` on the wayfinding HUD,
 * `1.2 km` on the OSM demo's map, `1.23 km` in the recorder's session summary —
 * and none of them knew about the others.
 *
 * WHY IT TAKES OPTIONS RATHER THAN UNIFYING THE OUTPUT. The three genuinely
 * want different precision, and that is not an accident to be flattened: a
 * world-space HUD label a few metres away, a map label naming a walk, and a
 * session total are read in different situations. What is worth unifying is the
 * RULE — where the kilometre boundary sits, how rounding works, what happens
 * below zero — so a fourth caller inherits the decisions instead of inventing
 * them.
 *
 * The options are deliberately few and each one is a decision a caller has
 * actually made. A formatter with a knob per past disagreement is the shape
 * nobody can predict the output of.
 *
