// --- escape-html and toast-core are DELIBERATELY NOT re-exported here ---
//
// Both are reached as their own subpaths — `.../utils/escape-html` and
// `.../utils/toast-core` — which the package's `exports` map already serves via
// `./utils/*`, and both are listed as knip entries so `check:deadcode` treats
// them as the public entry points they are.
//
// Barrelling them would have put them in `src/index.ts`'s `export *` and so on
// the package's ROOT export surface, which is the largest possible version of
// the cost DEC-H2 accepted reluctantly — for helpers whose only consumers
// deep-import them anyway. A review caught that; the re-exports were removed.
// Importing them through this barrel would also drag in the logger and
// everything else listed above.
