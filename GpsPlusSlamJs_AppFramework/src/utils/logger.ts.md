# logger.ts

## Purpose

Configurable logging utility that provides a simple API with log levels. Also maintains an in-memory ring buffer of recent log entries for display in the expandable log panel UI (User Feedback Issue #5).

## Public API

### Types

```typescript
export enum LogLevel {
  DEBUG = 0,
  INFO = 1,
  WARN = 2,
  ERROR = 3,
  SILENT = 4,
}

export interface Logger {
  debug: (...args: unknown[]) => void;
  info: (...args: unknown[]) => void;
  warn: (...args: unknown[]) => void;
  error: (...args: unknown[]) => void;
}

export interface LogEntry {
  readonly timestamp: number; // Unix timestamp (Date.now())
  readonly level: LogLevel;
  readonly tag: string; // Source module
  readonly message: string; // Stringified log content
}
```

### `createLogger(tag: string): Logger`

Creates a logger with a specific tag prefix.

```typescript
const log = createLogger('GPS');
log.info('Watch started'); // Console: [GPS] Watch started
log.error('Error:', err); // Console: [GPS] Error: <error details>
```

### `setGlobalLogLevel(level: LogLevel): void`

Sets the minimum log level. Messages below this level are not output to console (but still added to buffer).

### `getGlobalLogLevel(): LogLevel`

Returns the current global log level.

### `getLogBuffer(): LogEntry[]`

Returns a **copy** of the log buffer. Safe to mutate without affecting internal state.

### `clearLogBuffer(): void`

Clears all entries from the log buffer.

### `subscribeToLogs(callback: (entry: LogEntry) => void): () => void`

Subscribe to new log entries. Returns an unsubscribe function.

```typescript
const unsubscribe = subscribeToLogs((entry) => {
  console.log('New log:', entry.message);
});

// Later...
unsubscribe();
```

## Invariants & Assumptions

1. **Ring buffer limit:** Maximum 100 entries. When exceeded, oldest entries are dropped.

2. **Buffer vs Console:** All log calls add to buffer regardless of log level. Console output is filtered by `globalLogLevel`.

3. **Safe message serialization:** Arguments are serialized safely to strings:
   - **Error instances:** Serialized to JSON with `name`, `message`, `stack`, and any enumerable properties (e.g., `code`, `retryable`).
   - **Circular references:** Handled gracefully; cycles are replaced with `[Circular]` placeholder.
   - **Special types:** BigInt, Symbol, and functions are converted to descriptive strings.
   - **Null/undefined:** Converted to literal strings `"null"` and `"undefined"`.
   - **Fallback:** If serialization still fails, `[Unserializable]` is used.
   - **Logging never throws** due to serialization errors.

4. **Subscriber notification:** Subscribers are notified synchronously for each log call.

5. **Thread safety:** Not applicable (single-threaded JS), but care is taken to avoid mutation of returned buffer copies.

   **`LogEntry` is fully readonly** — a record is immutable once created. Pinned
   at the type level by the `LogEntry ≡ Readonly<LogEntry>` guard in
   `logger.test.ts` (Finding #6, 2026-03-05 code review), so widening a field
   back to mutable fails the build rather than silently allowing buffer edits.

6. **Sentry integration:** All log levels add Sentry breadcrumbs for debugging context. When an exception is later captured, Sentry will show the trail of log messages leading up to it. Additionally, both `warn` and `error` produce standalone Sentry **Issues** (so the Issues dashboard is the single place to watch anything logged at warn/error level):
   - `log.warn()` calls `Sentry.captureMessage(message, { level: 'warning', fingerprint: [...] })`.
   - `log.error()` with one or more `Error` arguments calls `Sentry.captureException()` for each `Error` (full stack trace).
   - `log.error()` with **no** `Error` argument (string-only) falls back to `Sentry.captureMessage(message, { level: 'error', fingerprint: [...] })`. The fallback is mutually exclusive with `captureException`, so an error carrying an `Error` never also produces a message Issue.
   - **Template-based fingerprint grouping:** the fingerprint is `['log', level, tag, template]`, where `template` is the message with its dynamic tokens normalized. This collapses dynamic values into a single Issue **per message kind**, while two genuinely different messages that share a `tag` stay as separate Issues. The `tag` identifies the source module, not the kind of message, so it is intentionally _not_ the sole grouping key. `debug`/`info` remain breadcrumb-only.
     - **Normalized (replaced with placeholders) by `toFingerprintTemplate`:**
       - UUIDs → `{uuid}` (matched first, before numbers, so digit groups inside a UUID are not shredded).
       - Numbers → `{n}`: signed, decimal, and exponent forms (`-3.5`, `1e3`, `100`). Because numbers run before the quoted-string rule, a quoted path with an embedded index (`"actions/000001.json"`) collapses entirely to `"{str}"`. ISO timestamps fold into a stable (if lossy) numeric template via this rule — no dedicated date rule exists.
       - Quoted strings → `"{str}"` / `'{str}'` (both quote styles).
     - **Deliberately NOT normalized** (verified against real call sites — over-normalizing these would merge distinct problems, which is worse than mild fragmentation):
       - Free-form appended `error.message` text — it carries the actual diagnosis and must keep distinct errors as distinct Issues.
       - Bare (unquoted, non-UUID) identifiers/paths such as `${pointId}`, `${name}`, `${entry.fullPath}` — a rule broad enough to catch these would also swallow ordinary English words (e.g. hex-only words). Wrap such values in quotes at the call site if you want them grouped.

## Examples

```typescript
import {
  createLogger,
  LogLevel,
  setGlobalLogLevel,
  getLogBuffer,
} from './logger';

// Production: suppress debug logs in console
setGlobalLogLevel(LogLevel.INFO);

const log = createLogger('App');
log.debug('Verbose info'); // Not in console, but in buffer
log.info('App started'); // In console and buffer

// Access recent logs
const buffer = getLogBuffer();
console.log(`${buffer.length} log entries in buffer`);
```

## Tests

Unit tests in [logger.test.ts](logger.test.ts) cover:

- Logger creation with tag prefix
- Log level filtering for console output
- Ring buffer storage (100 entry limit)
- Buffer independence (returns copy)
- Buffer entries added regardless of log level
- Subscription and unsubscription
- Multiple subscriber support
- **Subscriber isolation, via `utils/isolated-registry.ts`.** The list is one of
  the framework's isolated registries, with `console.error` as its sink — not
  this module's own logging, which would append an entry, notify the
  subscribers, and throw again. That hazard is why the registry requires the
  sink rather than defaulting to one, and why it imports no logger (which would
  also make `logger → isolated-registry → logger` a cycle).
  - Adopting it fixed an inconsistency: the old array deferred _unsubscribes_
    by accident (`filter` REASSIGNS, so an in-flight `for...of` kept the old
    array) while `push` mutated in place, so a subscriber added mid-dispatch
    received the entry it had not been subscribed for. Both now defer.
- Safe serialization of Error instances (name, message, stack, enumerable props)
- Safe handling of circular references
- Graceful handling of null, undefined, BigInt, Symbol, and functions
- **Sentry integration:**
  - Breadcrumbs added for all log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
  - `captureMessage` called with `'warning'` level and a `['log', 'warning', tag, template]` fingerprint for `log.warn()`
  - Warnings of the same kind (same normalized template) share a fingerprint despite dynamic message content (grouped into one Issue)
  - Genuinely different warnings that share a tag get different fingerprints (kept as separate Issues)
  - `captureException` called for Error objects in `log.error()`
  - Multiple Error objects in single `log.error()` call all reported
  - String-only `log.error()` falls back to `captureMessage` with `'error'` level and a `['log', 'error', tag, template]` fingerprint
  - Numbers and UUIDs in messages are normalized so otherwise-identical lines group together
  - `captureMessage` is NOT called when an `Error` is present in `log.error()` (no duplicate Issue)
  - `captureMessage` NOT called for debug/info logs
  - Non-Error arguments don't trigger `captureException`
  - `log.debug/info/warn` with Error objects don't trigger `captureException`
- **Fingerprint template normalization** (`toFingerprintTemplate`, derived from a review of real call sites):
  - Signed / decimal / exponent numbers all normalize to `{n}`
  - ISO 8601 timestamps group via the number rule (stable, if lossy, template)
  - A double-quoted path with an embedded number fully collapses to `"{str}"` (number rule runs before the quote rule)
  - Single-quoted strings normalize the same as double-quoted
  - A message mixing several token kinds (numbers + quoted filename) groups across differing concrete values
  - Free-form `error.message` text is NOT normalized (distinct errors stay distinct — deliberate boundary)
  - Bare unquoted non-UUID identifiers are NOT normalized (deliberate boundary)
