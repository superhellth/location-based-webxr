# fused-path.bench.ts

## Purpose

Tinybench smoke benchmark for [`computeFusedPath`](fused-path.ts) — the first `*.bench.ts` file in the framework, proving the `pnpm bench` harness on a real code path (deliverable of the 2026-07-09 bench-infra plan: capability, not coverage).

## What it measures

- `computeFusedPath` over 1 000 and 10 000 odometry positions (≈1.5 min and ≈15 min of 10 Hz recording) with a realistic yaw+translation alignment matrix.
- The function runs over the full trajectory whenever the session-summary map is built, so cost scales with recording length; the two sizes expose that scaling.

## Invariants & assumptions

- `computeFusedPath` is pure — inputs are reused across iterations without a `setup` callback (unlike the library's `addGpsObservation` bench, which must clone state per iteration).
- Inputs are deterministic; no PRNG needed.
- Wall-clock numbers are machine-dependent — this is a measurement instrument, never an assertion gate. Results land in `docs/perf-baselines/bench-results.json` (versioned, ride-along churn policy).

## Usage

```bash
cd GpsPlusSlamJs_AppFramework
pnpm bench
```

## Tests

Not a test itself; excluded from test discovery (`*.bench.ts` does not match the test config's includes) and from coverage. Validated by running `pnpm bench`.
