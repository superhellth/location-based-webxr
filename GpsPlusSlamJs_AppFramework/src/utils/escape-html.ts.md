# `escape-html.ts`

## Purpose

Escapes text before it reaches an HTML sink — in practice, Leaflet's
`bindTooltip`, which renders its argument as HTML.

**The canonical escaper for this workspace.** It lived in
`GpsPlusSlamJs_OsmDemo` until 2026-08-24 and moved here when a second, weaker
copy was found in `GpsPlusSlamJs_Landing` — four characters instead of five.
Landing keeps a copy rather than importing this one, because it does not depend
on this package and adding that edge to a marketing site to share ten lines is
the worse trade.

**`tests/repo-config/escape-html-copies.test.js` holds the two to the same
contract**: the same characters mapped to the same entities, and the same
character class in the regex. It compares the extracted TABLE rather than the
source text, because the two cannot be made character-identical — this package
sets `singleQuote: true` and Landing takes prettier's default, so they disagree
on every quote in the table and always will. A guard that cannot be satisfied is
a guard nobody writes.

## Public API

- `escapeHtml(value: string): string` — replaces `& < > " '` with their
  entities. Total; never throws.
- Import it **deep**: `gps-plus-slam-app-framework/utils/escape-html`. It is
  deliberately NOT re-exported from the `/utils` barrel, which would place it on
  the package's root export surface and drag the logger into any consumer that
  wanted five lines of string replacement.

## Invariants & assumptions

- **The inputs are untrusted** in the case this was written for. Category names
  come from `discoverCategories` in the OSM demo,
  which reads the column headers of a **publicly editable Google Sheet** and
  accepts any name up to `MAX_CATEGORY_NAME_LENGTH` (20) with no character-set
  restriction. `<svg onload=x>` is 14 characters, so the length cap is not a
  mitigation — a test asserts exactly that.
  - `rule-table-loader.ts` already calls that sheet "the only thing standing
    between a bad edit to a publicly-editable Google Sheet and every downstream
    app's behaviour", so this closes an inconsistency rather than inventing a
    threat model.
- **Escaped at the sink, not restricted at the source.** Limiting category names
  to `[A-Za-z0-9_]` in `discoverCategories` was the alternative and is not taken:
  it silently drops legitimate owner-authored names (spaces, umlauts) for every
  consumer, to fix a problem that belongs to the sink.
- **`&` is escaped in the same pass, so entities double-escape.** `&amp;` becomes
  `&amp;amp;`. Displaying a stray `&amp;` is a cosmetic bug; letting an input
  `&lt;` survive as a literal `<` is a hole.
- **A plain string transform, not `textContent` on a detached node** — this
  module is unit-tested in Node, where there is no DOM.

## Examples

```ts
.bindTooltip(`<strong>${escapeHtml(category)} = ${round(score)}</strong>`)
```

## Tests

`escape-html.test.ts` — the in-budget `<svg onload=x>` payload, all five
characters, an attribute-context break-out via quotes, double-escaping of an
existing entity, and ordinary names (including one with an umlaut) passing
through untouched.
