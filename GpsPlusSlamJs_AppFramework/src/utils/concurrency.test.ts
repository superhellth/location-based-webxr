/**
 * Tests for concurrency utilities.
 *
 * Why these tests matter: The mapWithConcurrencyLimit utility controls how many
 * async operations run simultaneously. This is critical for memory-efficient
 * scanning of many large zip files (discoverScenariosFromZipMetadata) — without
 * a concurrency cap, Promise.all on 50 large zips would load all of them into
 * memory at once, potentially crashing the browser tab.
