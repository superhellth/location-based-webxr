/**
 * Style for per-event GPS accuracy circles. Radius comes from the GPS event's
 * horizontal accuracy in meters; larger circles mean lower-quality fixes.
 *
 * Circles are drawn **stroke-only** (no fill): Leaflet composites overlapping
 * semi-transparent SVG fills, so N stacked filled circles reach
 * `1 − (1 − fillOpacity)^N` opacity and paint the basemap solid on dense
 * recordings (~90 % at ~18 overlaps with the old 0.12 fill). A fill-free
 * outline never accumulates an opaque interior, so the basemap shows through at
 * ANY overlap density while each accuracy radius stays readable.

/**

 * pre-accuracy recordings still render their polyline.
 *
 * Circles are added to `map` immediately. The caller is responsible for
 * draw-order: invoke this BEFORE adding the polyline so the line stays
 * visually on top of the circles.
 *
 * @param map - The Leaflet map to add circles to.
 * @param samples - GPS samples to consider; non-positive / non-finite
 *   `accuracy` values are silently skipped.
 * @param color - CSS color string used for the stroke (no fill is drawn).
 * @returns The created `L.Circle` instances, in the order they were added.
 *   Callers that track layers for cleanup can append these to their list.
