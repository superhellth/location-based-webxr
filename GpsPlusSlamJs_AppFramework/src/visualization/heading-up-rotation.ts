/**
 * Heading-up minimap rotation helper.
 *
 * The live in-AR minimap is a Leaflet map wrapped in a three.js `CSS3DObject`
 * lying flat below the camera. Its baseline orientation is a single −π/2
 * rotation about the local +X axis (`tilt`), which lays the DOM plane flat so
 * the user looks down on a NORTH-UP map (its plane normal points world +Y).
 *
 * "Heading-up" mode spins that flat map in its own plane so the user's view
 * direction always points up/forward. We do this by composing a yaw about the
 * world up axis (+Y) with the baseline tilt:
 *
 *     quaternion = yaw(−headingDeg about +Y) · tilt(−π/2 about +X)
 *
 * Because the yaw is about +Y and the tilted plane's normal is already +Y, the
 * normal is invariant under the yaw — the map stays flat and merely rotates
 * in-plane. The map's parent (`CameraFollower`) is rotation-identity, so the
 * object-local axes equal world axes; the yaw is therefore about true world up.
 *
 * Sign: the *magnitude* and *axis* of the rotation are pinned by
 * `heading-up-rotation.test.ts`; the *perceived* turn direction was
 * device-verified correct with `YAW_SIGN = -1` (2026-06-29, see
 * gps-plus-slam/GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-06-29-0752-heading-up-minimap-rotation-plan.md).
 * `YAW_SIGN` remains the one place to flip if a future frame/convention change
 * ever inverts it.

 *
 * Why this is needed for heading-up: the minimap is world-locked (its parent is
 * rotation-identity) but it is composited through the **live head-tracked
 * camera**, so the camera already rotates the map's on-screen appearance as the
 * user turns. The map's local heading-up yaw must therefore be expressed
 * RELATIVE to the camera, not in absolute GPS-north terms — otherwise the
 * camera's rotation is double-counted and the result is only correct at a single
 * heading (the difference being the GPS↔scene alignment yaw). The consumer rolls
 * the alignment offset out by feeding `headingUpQuat(viewAzimuth − userHeading)`.
 *
