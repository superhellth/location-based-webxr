# `gps-anchor.ts`

## Purpose

`createGpsAnchor` is the GPS-anchored placement primitive for a single
`THREE.Object3D`. It owns the object's local transform inside an
`arWorldGroup`. The target is a GPS-world **NUE** point derived from the
stored GPS coordinate and the GPS zero reference. Because the managed
object is parented to `arWorldGroup` — whose local matrix **is** the
alignment matrix (AR-odometry NUE → GPS-world NUE) — the GPS-world target
must be expressed in the group's local frame by pre-multiplying with
`alignment⁻¹`. This conversion is delegated to the
[`nueToArLocal`](frame-conversions.ts) helper. The component then decides
when to commit the new pose using a configurable mode flag.

See the alignment-frame bug doc for why the inverse is required and how
the regression was found:
[2026-05-31-gps-anchor-alignment-frame-bug.md](../../../../../gps-plus-slam/GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-05-31-gps-anchor-alignment-frame-bug.md).

This is the JS port of the C# `GpsAnchor` / `GpsAnchorForNonEcsGos`
sibling pair, merged into one component because in the JS scene-graph
world they only differ by the steady-state commit policy.

For the design rationale, state machine, threshold formulas, and
parenting rules see the dedicated port plan:
[2026-05-13-gps-anchor-port-plan.md](../../../../../gps-plus-slam/GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-05-13-gps-anchor-port-plan.md).

## Status

This file currently implements **sub-steps 2 (bootstrap phase),
3 (steady-state `'snap-every-tick'` + distance-scaled threshold gate),
4 (`'snap-when-offscreen'` mode gate + alignment-matrix large-jump
bypass), and 5 (re-bootstrap on external move)** of the port plan.
Floor-Y correction (sub-step 6) is deferred until the depth raycaster
(Item 6 in the C# survey) lands; the `floorY?: () => number | null`
constructor seam is reserved but not yet consulted.

## Public API

- `type GpsAnchorMode = 'snap-when-offscreen' | 'snap-every-tick'` —
  steady-state commit policy. Default `'snap-when-offscreen'`.
- `type GpsAnchorPhase = 'bootstrap' | 'anchored'`.
- `type GpsAnchorSamplePoint = LatLong | LatLongAlt`.
- `interface GpsAnchorOptions` — required: `object3D`, `arWorldGroup`,
  `camera`, `gpsPoint`, `getAlignmentMatrix`, `getGpsZeroRef`,
  `getCurrentGpsPoint`. Optional: `skipBootstrap`, `mode`, `floorY`,
  `distanceThreshold` (default 2 m), `angleThresholdInDegrees`
  (default 15°), `targetPosRefreshRateInSec` (default 3 s),
  `secondsToAccumulateGpsPose` (default 7 samples at 1 Hz),
  `settlingSeconds` (default 0), `heightAboveGround`.
- `createGpsAnchor(options) → GpsAnchor` — the factory.
- `interface GpsAnchor` — `phase`, `isFullyAnchored`, `gpsPoint`,
  `markMovedExternally()`, `setGpsPoint(point)`, `dispose()`.

The `__tickForTests(dt, elapsed)` method is exposed on the returned
object as an `@internal` testing seam in lieu of pumping the global
`runFrameUpdates`. Production code MUST NOT call it.

## Invariants & assumptions

- **No nested anchors**: a `THREE.Object3D` whose parent chain already
  contains a `GpsAnchor`-managed object cannot be anchored — the
  constructor throws. Mirrors the C# invariant. Implementation: a
  module-level `WeakSet<Object3D>` tracks managed objects.
- **Self-registers with the frame loop**: the anchor registers via
  `registerFrameUpdate` at construction time and unregisters in
  `dispose()`. Callers do not pump it manually.
- **`elapsed` is monotonic seconds**: tied to `XRFrame.time / 1000`.
  Tests inject controlled values via `__tickForTests`.
- **Bootstrap median is per-coordinate**: `lat`, `lon`, and (if any
  sample carries one) `altitude` are independently medianed. Per-coord
  median is more robust to single-axis spikes than a vector median.
- **Sampling rate is 1 Hz**: at most one sample collected per second
  of wall-clock `elapsed`. The `secondsToAccumulateGpsPose` field is
  the _sample count_ (default 7), not the window length — together
  with 1 Hz sampling this is also the window length in the default
  case.
- **`secondsToAccumulateGpsPose` must be >= 1**: the constructor throws
  for any sub-1 value (e.g. `0`). A `0` would otherwise commit the
  median after the first received sample, silently degrading the
  accumulation phase into a misconfiguration. To intentionally skip
  accumulation, pass `skipBootstrap: true` (the supported bypass).
  The throw cleans up the `WeakSet` registration so a later valid
  anchor on the same object3D is still allowed.
- **`getCurrentGpsPoint` returning null is a non-error**: the tick is
  silently skipped (no sample pushed, `lastSampleAtElapsed` not
  updated, so the next tick will retry). Mirrors "no fix yet".
- **`gpsPoint` getter reflects the committed pose**: during
  `'bootstrap'` it is the seed; after the median is committed it is
  the median. Callers may use it to decide visibility (e.g. ghost the
  object until `isFullyAnchored`).
- **Steady-state commits snap instantly**: when the commit gate accepts a
  correction the object's local pose is set with `object3D.position.copy(target)`
  (no per-anchor easing). Smoothing is done **once** at `arWorldGroup` via
  `enableArWorldGroupAlignment` (the framework default that lerps
  `arWorldGroup.matrix`), so the camera and every anchored child shift together
  and each accepted commit here is only a small off-screen residual. The commit
  **gate** (distance-scaled threshold + `snap-when-offscreen` frustum
  suppression + large-jump bypass) decides _when_ a correction lands; the snap
  decides _how_ (instantly). A previous per-anchor lerp (`lerpCorrections` /
  `correctionLerpRate`, D1′) was removed once alignment was lerped at
  `arWorldGroup` — see
  `gps-plus-slam/GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-06-05-gps-anchor-frame-architecture-bug-and-plan.md`.

## Examples

```ts
import { createGpsAnchor } from 'gps-plus-slam-app-framework/visualization';

const anchor = createGpsAnchor({
  object3D: myMesh,
  arWorldGroup,
  camera,
  gpsPoint: { lat: 48.0, lon: 11.0 }, // seed
  getAlignmentMatrix: () => store.getState().gpsData.alignmentMatrix,
  getGpsZeroRef: () => store.getState().gpsData.zero,
  getCurrentGpsPoint: () => store.getState().gpsData.latest?.position ?? null,
  mode: 'snap-when-offscreen',
});

// Later, on user drag or re-survey:
anchor.markMovedExternally();
```

## Tests

See [gps-anchor.test.ts](gps-anchor.test.ts). Coverage:

- Bootstrap (sub-step 2):
  - Initial phase + `isFullyAnchored`.
  - `skipBootstrap: true` short-circuit.
  - 1 Hz sampling and median commit at the configured count.
  - Median robustness against a single outlier.
  - `settlingSeconds` window correctly suppresses sampling.
  - `null` GPS reading: tick is skipped, not counted as a sample.
  - `markMovedExternally` resets the buffer and re-bootstraps.
  - `dispose` unregisters from the frame loop.
  - Nested-anchor detection throws.
  - Sub-1 `secondsToAccumulateGpsPose` (`0`, `-1`) throws, and the
    failed construction does not leave the object3D registered.
- Steady state — `'snap-every-tick'` (sub-step 3):
  - NUE target committed on the first tick after bootstrap.
  - No position writes while still in the bootstrap phase.
  - `setGpsPoint` triggers re-commit past the threshold gate.
  - Sub-threshold delta does NOT commit.
  - Distance-scaled threshold: same delta commits up close, skips far
    away.
  - `null` `zeroRef` suppresses the commit.
- Steady state — `'snap-when-offscreen'` + large-jump bypass (sub-step 4):
  - On-screen object: no commit even when threshold gate would allow.
  - Off-screen object: commits.
  - 10 m translation jump bypasses the on-screen mode gate.
  - 1 m translation does NOT bypass.
  - 25 m Y-only jump bypasses.
  - 30° rotation jump bypasses.
- Re-bootstrap on external move (sub-step 5):
  - No position writes while back in bootstrap; resumes with the
    new median target once re-anchored.
  - Large-jump baseline is cleared on `markMovedExternally` so the
    first steady-state tick after re-bootstrap doesn't spuriously
    trigger the bypass.

- Alignment-frame correctness (bug doc):
  - Object reaches the correct **world** position under a non-trivial
    (rotated + translated) alignment — the `alignment⁻¹` mapping is
    applied, not skipped or doubled.
  - World position stays fixed as the alignment changes between ticks.
  - `null`/`undefined` alignment skips the commit (no NaN write).
  - The metre-scale distance threshold is preserved under a rigid
    alignment.
- Cross-consumer convention consistency (bug doc, Action item 3):
  - `createGpsAnchor` lands a GPS point at the same world position as a
    scene-root raw-NUE consumer (`sync-gps-anchored-meshes` /
    `gps-event-markers` raw GPS markers).
- Property-based (see
  [`gps-anchor.property.test.ts`](gps-anchor.property.test.ts)):
  - Anchored object world position is invariant under any rigid
    alignment matrix.
  - `inverse(M) ∘ M ≈ identity` for any generated rigid alignment.
