/**
 * OccluderMeshDriver — coalescing + synchronous-fallback + error-recovery tests.
 *
 * The driver is the main-thread half of the Web Worker occluder offload. These
 * pin the policies that make it safe under a growing grid: at most one job in
 * flight with the NEWEST request winning (intermediates dropped), a synchronous
 * fallback when no worker is available, and — critically — **recovery from a
 * worker that never replies** (an uncaught throw in the worker, or a module that
 * fails to load). Without recovery the in-flight slot would stay set forever and
 * the occluder would silently freeze for the rest of the session (the 2026-07-01
 * "Phase 1 gap"). A fake poster stands in for a real Worker so the seam is
 * unit-tested without a worker environment.
