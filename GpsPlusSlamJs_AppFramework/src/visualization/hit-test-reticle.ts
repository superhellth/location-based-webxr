/**
 * Hit-test reticle — the small, deterministic "reticle view-model" shared by
 * the framework's example/starter apps.
 *
 * A faithful port of the reticle from the stock three.js `webxr_ar_hittest`
 * example: a flat ring laid on whatever real-world surface the WebXR
 * `hit-test` API reports under the screen centre. The framework delta is
 * *where* the mesh is parented and *which frame the hit pose is in*: apps add
 * the mesh under `getArWorldGroup()` (NUE local space) rather than the
 * GPS-aligned scene root, so the reticle rides the same lerped `arWorldGroup`
 * alignment as the camera — but the WebXR hit pose arrives in the WebXR
 * reference space, so `updateReticle` applies the `WEBXR_TO_NUE` basis change
 * to it (see that function for the full rationale).
 *
 * The per-frame XR plumbing (requesting the hit-test source, reading
 * `frame.getHitTestResults(...)`) stays in each app's WebXR glue and is
 * verified manually on-device. The two functions here are the unit-tested core:
 * given the latest hit pose (a column-major 4x4 transform matrix) or `null`,
 * drive the mesh's visibility + transform. They are unit tested because that is
 * the logic a porting developer is most likely to get subtly wrong (e.g.
 * forgetting the basis change so the reticle drifts off-centre, forgetting to
 * hide the reticle when no surface is found, or letting Three.js overwrite the
 * matrix).

/**
 * Apply the latest hit-test pose to the reticle.
 *
 * - When `matrix` is a 16-element transform, the reticle adopts it (after the
 *   WebXR→NUE basis change, see below) and becomes visible.
 * - When `matrix` is `null` (no surface under the screen centre, or the
 *   hit-test source is not ready yet), the reticle is hidden.
 *
 * Frame handling — the part a porting developer must not get wrong. The
 * hit-test pose is expressed in the **WebXR reference space** (`X=East, Y=Up,
 * Z=South`), the same frame as the live camera pose. The reticle, however, is
 * parented under `getArWorldGroup()`, whose local space is **NUE** (`X=North,
 * Y=Up, Z=East`) — the camera reaches that frame through the static
 * `basisChangeNode` that holds `WEBXR_TO_NUE`. The reticle has no such
 * intermediate node, so we apply the same basis change here:
 * `reticle.matrix = WEBXR_TO_NUE · hitPose`. The reticle's resulting world pose
 * is then `arWorldGroup.matrix · WEBXR_TO_NUE · hitPose` — identical to the
 * transform chain the camera rides, so it stays pinned under the screen centre.
 *
 * Without the basis change the WebXR coordinates were interpreted as NUE: the
 * Up axis matched (both are Y) but East/North were swapped, so the reticle
 * drifted sideways instead of tracking the screen centre.
 *
 * Works on any `Object3D` (not just the mesh from `createReticleMesh`) so it can
 * be unit tested without a WebGL context.
