/**
 * Derive-on-read layer for QR detections (decision D-A of the recorder live-QR
 * plan, docs `2026-06-17-recorder-live-qr-detection-recording-plan.md`).
 *
 * The `qrDetected` slice persists the RAW detector output per observation —
 * pixel corners + the raw WebXR camera pose + the detector-frame projection
 * matrix + frame dimensions + timestamp — and NOT a solved pose. The metric
 * size and the solved pose are DERIVED here, on read, so swapping the size or
 * PnP algorithm and re-running a recording yields a new result (the maintainer's
 * "record raw, re-test" principle). The same functions run live and on replay —
 * they only differ in the injected `resolveDepthAt` (live: the current depth
 * sample; replay: the recorded depth stream), so live == replay by construction.
 *
 * Depth is injected as a single {@link DeriveQrPoseDeps.resolveDepthAt} function:
 * that IS the as-of join — "the depth-sampling context active at this detection's
 * timestamp". The QR observation stays pure-raw and carries NO depth; the depth
 * grid lives in its own recorded stream (`recordDepthSample`), the single source
 * of truth for ALL sizing algorithms (so a denser/sub-pixel sizing variant can
 * still be re-tested from a recording). See the plan §3 / §6.
 *
 * This module lives in `ar/` (not `state/`) and is purely structural — it never
 * imports the `qrDetected` slice, so the `ar → state` cycle stays open. The slice
 * adapts its `QrDetectionEntry` to {@link RawQrObservation} and delegates here.
 *
 * @see qr-pose.ts — `solveQrPose` / `intrinsicsFromProjection` (the PnP it composes).
 * @see qr-size-measurer.ts — `createQrSizeMeasurer` (the depth→size accumulator).
