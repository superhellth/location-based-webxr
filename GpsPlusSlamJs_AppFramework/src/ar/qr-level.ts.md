# qr-level.ts

**Purpose:** Fetch + defensively validate the QR level file (§8) — Phase 6 of
the [QR-code detection & tracking plan](../../../../gps-plus-slam/GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-06-15-qr-code-detection-tracking-plan.md).
The printed QR encodes only a URL; the level file carries `physicalSizeM`
(drives the pose solve + size self-check), the absolute `geo` pose (drives the
synthetic vote), and the AR `content`.

Both `physicalSizeM` and `geo` are **optional** (Note 3 of the
[follow-up plan](../../../../gps-plus-slam/GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-06-15-followup-qr-tracking-generalization-overlay-and-north.md):
flat optionals + capability model). Their **presence** gates capabilities and
the use-cases combine: `geo` present → the GPS vote runs; `physicalSizeM`
present → size is authored (else it must be **measured** first — the Note 4
depth path — before size-dependent features unlock); neither → a
debug/observe or trigger-only level. `qr` itself is still required as an object.

## Public API

- `parseQrLevel(data: unknown): QrLevel` — validate an already-parsed value;
  throws `QrLevelValidationError` with a descriptive message. Heading is
  normalized into `[0, 360)`.
- `fetchQrLevel(url, { fetchImpl?, signal? }): Promise<QrLevel>` — fetch + parse
  - validate; rejects on non-OK response, non-JSON body, network failure, or
    schema violation. `fetchImpl` defaults to global `fetch`.
- `QrLevel`, `QrLevelValidationError`, `FetchLike`, `FetchQrLevelOptions`.

## Invariants & assumptions

- **External, user-authored data → validated at the boundary:** `version`
  finite; `qr` an object. `qr.physicalSizeM`, **when present**, a positive
  finite number (a `0`/negative authored size is a bug, not a "measure instead"
  signal). `qr.geo`, **when present**, fully valid: `lat∈[-90,90]`,
  `lon∈[-180,180]`, `alt` finite, `headingDeg` finite (a partial geo throws —
  it would silently place the vote wrong). Both fields may be absent.
- **`content` is opaque.** The AR content format is an open question (plan §12);
  it is carried through untouched and NOT interpreted here.
- **`qr.geo` is an optional `QrGeoPose`** — when present it feeds
  `buildQrGpsVotes` directly; when absent the controller skips the vote.
- Injected `fetchImpl` keeps the loader unit-testable and lets callers add
  caching/headers; the controller (`qr-tracking-controller.ts`) caches by URL.

## Tests

- `qr-level.test.ts` — valid parse (content preserved, heading normalized),
  the geo-less / size-less / bare-`qr` optional cases, rejection of a
  present-but-invalid size or partial geo and every malformed field; fetch
  success, non-OK, non-JSON, network failure, and propagated schema violation
  (all via an injected fetch).
