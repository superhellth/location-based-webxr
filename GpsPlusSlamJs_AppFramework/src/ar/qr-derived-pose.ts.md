# qr-derived-pose.ts

## Purpose

Derive-on-read layer for QR detections (decision **D-A** of the recorder live-QR plan).
Given the **raw** detector output per observation, recompute the metric **size** and the
solved **world pose** on read — so swapping the size/PnP algorithm and re-running a
recording yields a new result ("record raw, re-test"). Live and replay run the _same_
functions, differing only in the injected `resolveDepthAt`.

## Public API

- `interface RawQrObservation` — `{ text, corners (pixels, TL,TR,BR,BL), cameraPose (raw
WebXR), projectionMatrix (col-major GL), imageWidth, imageHeight, timestamp }`. The
  authoritative recorded shape; carries **no depth**.
- `interface DeriveQrPoseDeps` — `{ resolveDepthAt(timestamp) → QrSizeDepthContext | null,
solver: SolvePnpSquare, sizeOptions?, maxReprojectionErrorPx? }`.
- `deriveQrSizeM(text, observations, resolveDepthAt, sizeOptions?) → number | null` —
  replays the history through a fresh `createQrSizeMeasurer`, each observation sized
  against its own as-of depth; returns the running-median size or `null`.
- `solveQrPoseFromObservation(observation, sizeM, solver, maxReprojectionErrorPx?) → Pose |
null` — pure PnP solve of one observation (intrinsics from its projection + frame size).
- `deriveSolvedQrPose(text, observations, deps) → Pose | null` — accumulate size over the
  history, then solve the **latest** observation; `null` on empty history / unsizeable /
  PnP-rejected.

## Invariants & assumptions

- **`resolveDepthAt` IS the as-of join** — "depth context active at this timestamp". The
  observation stays pure-raw; the depth grid lives in its own recorded stream
  (`recordDepthSample`), the single source of truth for _all_ sizing algorithms.
- **No `ar → state` import.** This module is structural; the `qrDetected` slice adapts
  `QrDetectionEntry → RawQrObservation` and delegates here. Keeps the cycle open.
- **Cost:** `deriveQrSizeM`/`deriveSolvedQrPose` re-run the whole history per call —
  O(history), bounded by the slice ring buffer. Cheap for v1; memoize if the debug-viz
  cadence makes it hot.
- Returns `null` rather than throwing on any failure (best-effort viz contract).

## Examples

```ts
const pose = deriveSolvedQrPose('https://x', observations, {
  resolveDepthAt: (t) => depthContextAt(t), // live: current sample; replay: recorded stream
  solver: new PlanarPnpSquare(),
});
```

## Tests

- `qr-derived-pose.test.ts` — null paths (empty/no-depth), single-observation solve with an
  exact solver, and the **end-to-end re-test guarantee**: a raw observation forward-projected
  from a known pose, with the real `PlanarPnpSquare` + a constant-depth context, re-derives
  that same world pose (live == replay by construction).
- Slice-level mapping/guard: `state/qr-detected-slice.test.ts` (`selectSolvedQrPose`).
