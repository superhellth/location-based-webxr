/**
 * QR pose → synthetic GPS-vote bridge — Phase 5 of the QR-code detection &
 * tracking plan (§6).
 *
 * A detected QR is NOT a rigid re-anchor. Instead its solved pose is turned into
 * one (or, by default, four) very-high-weight synthetic GPS observation(s) and
 * injected into the existing weighted-Kabsch/RANSAC fusion via the normal
 * `recordGpsEvent` path. "Mostly but not entirely overrides the other votes"
 * then falls out of the existing accuracy→weight curve for free, and a single
 * bad detection is still rejectable as a RANSAC outlier rather than teleporting
 * the scene.
 *
 * Multi-correspondence (default): a single QR gives a full 6-DoF pose, but the
 * fusion is point-based. We know the QR's 4 corners in BOTH odom space (from the
 * solved pose + size) and geo space (corner offsets from the geo center via its
 * heading + size), so injecting the 4 corners as 4 observations lets ONE
 * detection immediately constrain rotation + translation. The corners are
 * coplanar, so the QR-normal (depth) DOF stays the least-constrained — exactly
 * what the occupancy self-check (`qr-occupancy-check.ts`, §7) guards.
 *
 * This module only BUILDS the payloads (pure, fully testable). Dispatching them
 * to the store is the caller's job (Phase 6 wiring).
 *
 * @see qr-pose.ts for the pose; gps-event-coordinator.ts for the normal path.
