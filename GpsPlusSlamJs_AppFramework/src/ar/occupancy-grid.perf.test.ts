/**
 * Occupancy grid — long-session scaling harness (2026-07-03 long-session fps
 * plan, acceptance criterion for Steps 1–3).
 *
 * Why this test matters: the plan's core claim is that consumer refresh cost
 * is now **bounded by the local neighbourhood** — independent of total
 * explored area — via the chunk-indexed windowed queries. The 2026-07-02 walk
 * corpus measured 87k–124k real cells after ~5 minutes, so the plan
 * calibrates the harness at 20k vs 200k cells (a 10× spread bracketing the
 * corpus). Two gates:
 *
 * 1. DETERMINISTIC: a fully-interior window over locally-identical geometry
 *    must return exactly the same cell count on the small and the large grid
 *    — the windowed OUTPUT is provably independent of total size.
 * 2. TIMING (loose, regression-catching): the windowed query on the 10×
 *    grid must stay within 4× of the small grid's time (an O(total-cells)
 *    regression would show ~10×). Wall-clock gates are deliberately loose —
 *    CI timing is machine-dependent (same policy as
 *    `occupancy-mesher.perf.test.ts`); exact numbers are logged for humans.
 *
 * A bytes-per-cell probe (Step 3.1's CellRecord flattening) is logged
 * informationally — heap deltas are GC-noisy, so it never gates.
