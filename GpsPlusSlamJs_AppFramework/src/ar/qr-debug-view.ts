/**
 * QR debug view — the shared 3D "is it glued to the code?" overlay: a 3D axis at
 * the solved QR pose plus a semi-transparent cube sized to the QR so its front
 * face lands on the printed corners. Both are parented under `arWorldGroup` so
 * they ride the alignment / transform chain exactly like real content.
 *
 * Promoted to the framework (recorder live-QR WS-5) as the **shared consumer**
 * view: both the QR-tracking demo and the GPS Recorder render this same overlay
 * off the derived pose (`qr-derived-pose.ts` / `selectSolvedQrPose`). The view is
 * pure three.js — it knows nothing about who solved the pose, so it runs
 * identically live and on replay.
 *
 * Persistence across detection misses: `update()` is called on every lock;
 * `clear()` is NOT called on a miss, so the objects keep their last pose and
 * never flicker between throttled detections. They stay hidden until the first
 * `update()`.
 *
 * Coordinate space (IMPORTANT): the QR pose is in **raw WebXR** space (the
 * corners are depth-unprojected with the raw WebXR camera pose), but the
 * injected `parent` (`arWorldGroup`) local space is **NUE**. So the objects must
 * ride the SAME {@link WEBXR_TO_NUE} basis the camera does (`arWorldGroup →
 * basisChangeNode → arpose → camera`). We mirror that by hanging them off an
 * internal basis node carrying `WEBXR_TO_NUE`; parenting them directly under
 * `arWorldGroup` would leave them East/North axis-swapped and they would NOT
 * line up with the camera/QR on a real device (the recurring scene-frame bug —
 * see the frame-tile / occupancy-cube / hit-test-reticle precedents). We never
 * touch the camera; WebXR owns its pose.
 *
 * @see qr-derived-pose.ts — derives the `Pose` this view renders (size + PnP).
 * @see webxr-nue-basis.ts — the `WEBXR_TO_NUE` basis the objects ride.
