/**
 * Chromium WebXR camera-access tab-crash workaround.
 *
 * Background:
 * Requesting `camera-access` as an optional WebXR feature on Android Chrome
 * 147+ causes a fatal renderer-process crash (`CrRendererMain`) 1–2 seconds
 * after entering AR. The crash reproduces in the upstream three.js
 * `webxr_ar_hittest.html` example with `optionalFeatures: ['camera-access']`
 * added — i.e. it is not specific to this app's session setup. See:
 *
 *   - GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-04-22-camera-access-reproducer-plan.md
 *   - GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-06-04-camera-access-crash-regression-chrome-148.md
 *   - https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/33404
 *   - https://issues.chromium.org/issues/507508099 (root-cause, marked Fixed)
 *
 * There is NOT a single crash here — the Chromium tracker notes the crash on
 * Chrome 147 is different from the crash on 148+, and the simple workaround
 * below only helped on a subset of versions. The empirically-verified
 * (on-device) timeline is:
 *
 *   - 147 : deleting `createProjectionLayer` / `layers` forces three.js onto
 *       `XRWebGLLayer` and sidesteps the crash (deletes-only is sufficient).
 *   - 148.x .. 149.0.7821 : the delete-only trick is NOT sufficient on its
 *       own. An ADDITIONAL patch is needed: persist the `baseLayer` reference
 *       across `XRSession.prototype.updateRenderState` so three.js's later
 *       `depthNear`/`depthFar` update does not drop the active `glBaseLayer`.
 *       (Confirmed on-device across the whole Chrome 148 line: BOTH the
 *       deletes and the baseLayer patch are required for the page not to
 *       crash, regardless of the exact 148 patch level.)
 *   - > 149.0.7821 (incl. Chrome 150) : the delete-only path is STILL required
 *       (confirmed on-device: Chrome 150 only stops crashing when the deletes
 *       are applied), but the extra baseLayer-persistence patch is NOT needed.
 *       The earlier assumption that Chromium fully fixed this on patched
 *       builds did not hold on real devices, so we no longer skip the
 *       workaround on "patched" Chrome.
 *
 * Resulting policy (see {@link applyChromiumProjectionLayerWorkaround}):
 *   - ALWAYS apply the deletes (every Chrome build, and unknown/non-Chromium
 *     environments — restoring the original always-on behavior).
 *   - Apply the baseLayer-persistence patch ONLY when a detected Chrome build
 *     falls inside the affected window
 *     [{@link BASELAYER_WINDOW_MIN} .. {@link BASELAYER_WINDOW_MAX}].
 *
 * Caveats:
 * - This is a Chromium-specific hack and the upstream comment explicitly
 *   warns it "might break webxr on other devices" — keep it opt-in.
 * - Must run BEFORE any WebXR session setup. Three.js reads these prototype
 *   members lazily when the first session starts, so calling this at app
 *   bootstrap (before `initAR()`) is sufficient.
 * - Idempotent: safe to call repeatedly. Safe on environments where the
 *   prototypes do not exist (e.g. desktop browsers, jsdom).
