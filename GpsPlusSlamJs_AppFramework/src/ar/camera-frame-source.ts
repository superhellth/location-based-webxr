/**
 * Camera frame source — a GENERIC throttled RGBA camera-frame feed for
 * computer-vision consumers (QR detection today; object detection / OpenCV
 * tomorrow). Framework-wiring-options Part A / B2.
 *
 * Mirrors {@link DepthSampler}'s shape: a per-XR-frame `onFrame(timestamp)`
 * tick that, **only when `intervalMs` has elapsed**, performs an injected
 * `capture()` (the GPU blit → top-left RGBA) and hands the result to
 * `onCapture`. Throttling the *capture itself* — not just the downstream detect
 * — is the efficiency win the in-session wiring unlocks (§A.4): on a 60 fps
 * device the blit runs ~8×/s instead of every render frame.
 *
 * **Single cadence owner (Option A).** When a {@link createDetectionScheduler}
 * (QR controller, object detector, …) is driven from this source, the source
 * should be the ONE place that sets the cadence: give it the detection
 * `intervalMs` and set the scheduler's own `minIntervalMs` to `0`. The
 * scheduler's coalescing still prevents overlapping in-flight detects, so every
 * delivered frame is detected without a second throttle dropping boundary
 * frames. (Two equal throttles in series let jitter drop ~1 frame per cycle.)
 *
 * `capture` is injected (not a hard dependency on `CameraBlitCapture` /
 * `WebGLRenderer`) so the throttle is pure-logic unit-testable without a GPU —
 * see `camera-frame-source.test.ts`, which pins the cadence as a performance
 * regression test.
 *
 * SCOPE — single consumer (by design, for now). The session wires exactly ONE
 * `CameraFrameSource` + one callback + one blit (`setCameraFrameCallback`). One
 * CV consumer at a time (QR *or* object detection) is the only current need.
 * If two live CV consumers must run **simultaneously** (e.g. QR + OpenCV object
 * detection at different cadences/resolutions), DO NOT bolt a second global
 * callback onto the session — generalize to a small **multi-consumer registry**:
 * `registerCameraFrameConsumer({ intervalMs, captureSize, onFrame }) =>
 * unregister`, each consumer getting its own throttle + (shared-where-equal)
 * blit. This class already supports that — it's per-instance and the cadence is
 * per-instance — so the change is in `webxr-session.ts`'s wiring, not here.
 *
 * @see camera-blit-capture.ts — `captureToRgba` (the production `capture`).
 * @see webxr-session.ts — owns the camera-frame blit and wires this in the frame loop.
