/**
 * Session-scoped disposer registry. Components that allocate a resource tied to
 * a single AR session — a store subscription, an event listener, a lerper —
 * register a teardown function here; the WebXR session's `resetWebXRState()`
 * flushes them on teardown so the resource never outlives the session it
 * belonged to.
 *
 * This is a sibling of `frame-loop.ts` (also a `Set`-based registry) but serves
 * a different need: `frame-loop` holds *per-frame ticks* invoked every frame and
 * wiped by `clearFrameUpdates()`; this registry holds *one-shot teardown* run
 * exactly once on session end. The split keeps each registry's contract crisp.
 *
 * Why it exists: `resetWebXRState()` already clears the frame-update registry,
 * but resources like the store subscription opened by
 * `enableArWorldGroupAlignment` are not per-frame ticks and had no teardown hook
 * — so they leaked across sessions (a dangling subscriber pinning the old
 * `arWorldGroup`). Because `initAR()` throws if a prior session is still live,
 * every restart must pass through `resetWebXRState()`, making it the single
 * chokepoint where flushing these disposers is guaranteed. See
 * gps-plus-slam/GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-06-08-arworldgroup-alignment-session-scoped-disposal.md.
