/**
 * Image-quality metrics + the drop/retry verdict policy for the image-content
 * capture gate (blur + blackness), the increment layered ON TOP of the motion
 * gate (`capture-motion-gate.ts`).
 *
 * Everything here is **pure and deterministic** — plain typed-array math plus a
 * tiny rolling-history class. There is **no DOM and no Web Worker** in this
 * module: it is fully unit-testable with synthetic buffers, and the recorder's
 * `image-quality.worker.ts` is a thin shell that decodes a frame to pixels and
 * calls into these functions. Keeping the verdict/history policy here (rather
 * than inside the worker, as the original plan §8 sketched) honours the project
 * rule that no untested logic ships: the worker is the device layer and is not
 * unit-built, so the median/threshold decision must live where tests can pin it.
 *
 * Metrics:
 *  - {@link sharpnessScore} — variance of the Laplacian over a grayscale buffer
 *    (the standard Pech-Pacheco focus measure). Scene-dependent in absolute
 *    terms, so the gate compares it RELATIVE to a rolling median (§5).
 *  - {@link meanLuminance} — mean Rec. 601 luma of an RGBA buffer. Near-zero ⇒
 *    black/empty frame; an absolute cutoff is safe because "black is black"
 *    regardless of scene texture (§5).
 *
 * @see GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-06-24-1057-image-quality-gate-plan.md
 * @see ./capture-motion-gate.ts — the motion gate this builds on (same shape:
 *   a shared config type + a small stateful window + a pure decision).
