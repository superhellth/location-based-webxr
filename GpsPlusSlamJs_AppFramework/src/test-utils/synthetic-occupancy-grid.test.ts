/**
 * buildSyntheticSurfaceGrid — placement-envelope regression tests.
 *
 * Why this test matters (PR #145 review, recorded in
 * 2026-07-01-1430-pr145-occluder-followups.md §2): the slab's −Z push (`kBase`)
 * must budget for EVERY transverse dimension of the box. It used to scale
 * with cellsX + cellsZ only, so a tall slab (large `thickness`) pushed the
 * top cells' worldY beyond the identity-projection view and tripped the loud
 * "fell outside the synthetic view" guard even though the options had passed
 * validation — a validated input must always build.
