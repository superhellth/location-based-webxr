/**
 * `makeNonTrivialAlignment` — build a deliberately ugly, non-symmetric
 * alignment matrix for coordinate-frame tests.
 *
 * Why this exists: the identity matrix is the worst possible fixture for a
 * transform test, because `identity⁻¹ · x === identity · x === x` makes a
 * whole family of *wrong* implementations (identity, double-application,
 * inverse, transpose-of-symmetric) indistinguishable from the correct one.
 * The `GpsAnchor` alignment-frame bug
 * (gps-plus-slam/GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-05-31-gps-anchor-alignment-frame-bug.md)
 * went undetected for exactly this reason. Default every transform test to a
 * non-axis rotation + non-zero translation; identity becomes a free
 * corollary that needs only an explicit degenerate-case test.
 *
 * The produced matrix is a **rigid** transform (rotation + translation,
 * unit scale) to mirror the real alignment matrix, whose RANSAC/Kabsch
 * solver yields scale ≈ 1. Unit scale keeps Euclidean distances preserved,
 * so threshold-gate semantics (which compare metre distances) survive the
 * change of frame — the matrix can be inverted and round-tripped exactly.
 *
 * Returned as a 16-element **column-major** array, matching both gl-matrix
 * `mat4` (how the production alignment matrix is computed) and
 * `THREE.Matrix4.fromArray` (how `applyAlignmentMatrix` consumes it).
