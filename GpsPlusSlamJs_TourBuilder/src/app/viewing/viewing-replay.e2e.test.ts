/**
 * **The §2.4 composed-flow test.** TASK.md asks for exactly this and says why
 * it matters: "an end-to-end replay test that loads a real tour zip, plays one
 * of your Task 1 walks through the app in viewing mode, and asserts that the
 * right knights become active (appear) at the right points along the route…
 * this is the test that proves all the pieces are plugged together correctly,
 * not just individually correct."
 *
 * What is REAL here, end to end:
 *
 * - component 5 packs the zip (`startFixtureServer` runs the real `packTour`),
 * - a real HTTP server serves it with real 206/Range semantics,
 * - component 6 opens it — real central-directory parse, real `validateTour`
 *   on the recovered `tour.json`, real ref-counted asset provider reading
 *   asset bytes by byte range,
 * - component 3's real store, component 4's real proximity machine, and
 *   component 8's real orchestrator drive the walk,
 * - the positions come from a real Task 1 outdoor recording.
 *
 * Substituted: only the rendering layer (`FakeSceneAdapter`) and, with it, the
 * GPS anchoring — the walk is already world-space, so waypoints use the
 * identity `lat`=X / `lon`=Z convention component 8's own demo documents. The
 * real geo path is covered by `ar-seams.test.ts` and, on device, by the
 * checklist in this directory's README (plan VC19).
 *
 * This is a strictly larger claim than component 8's own replay e2e: that one
 * hand-built a `Tour` object and a counting provider; this one gets its tour
 * AND its asset bytes through the real packaging → hosting → range-read →
 * asset-provider chain, which is where composition bugs actually live.
