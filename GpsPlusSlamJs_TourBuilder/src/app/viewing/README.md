# src/app/viewing — Goal-2 composition, Viewing mode

The visitor's half of the app (TASK.md §2.4): a scanned QR link becomes a
running AR tour. Composition code only — every component keeps its own demo
and its own tests; nothing here is imported by `src/components/`.

```
?tour=<zipUrl>  →  cloud-loader (6)  →  onboarding gate (9)  →  Enter AR  →  AR scene (8)
                                                                              + proximity (4)
                                                                              + map (7)
```

## Modules

| Path                       | What lives here                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `viewing-app.ts`           | The sequencer: screens, error states, the AR entry gesture, session lifecycle, progress persistence. The only stateful file here.     |
| `ar-seams.ts`              | The three seams component 8 injects — `createAnchor`, `toWorld`, `getUserWorldPos`. The single geo→world step §2.5.1 permits.        |
| `ar-scene-runtime.ts`      | Builds/tears down the live scene inside a session: alignment binding, audio listener, adapter (incl. the XR select ray), frame tick. |
| `audio-listener.ts`        | Hands the gate's unlocked `AudioContext` to three the one way that actually works (see below).                                        |
| `progress-store.ts`        | Visited waypoints in `localStorage`, so a reload or an evicted tab does not lose the visitor's place.                                 |
| `screens.ts` / `hud.ts`    | The non-immersive screens and the in-session HUD. Plain DOM, no store, no framework.                                                  |

## Three things that are easy to get wrong here

All three were found while planning/building this directory, and all three fail
**silently** — green unit tests, broken tour in the field. Each is pinned by a
test named after it.

1. **Waypoint anchors must pass `skipBootstrap: true`.** `GpsAnchorOptions
   .getCurrentGpsPoint` is optional, and when omitted the framework anchor
   bootstraps from *the object's own pose* and commits that median as its
   `gpsPoint`. AnchorStarter wants that (it is placing a new anchor); a tour
   already knows the coordinate, so bootstrapping would silently relocate the
   waypoint. → `ar-seams.ts`, `ar-seams.test.ts`.

2. **`isFullyAnchored` must be re-derived, not forwarded.** A `skipBootstrap`
   anchor reports `isFullyAnchored === true` from frame one — while its object
   still sits at the AR origin and no alignment matrix exists. Component 8
   feeds exactly the anchors reporting anchored to the proximity driver, so
   forwarding the raw flag puts every waypoint on top of the visitor at session
   entry: the whole tour activates, spawns and is marked visited in the first
   second. The wrapper reports anchored only once the object has actually been
   committed to its computed target. → `ar-seams.ts`, `ar-seams.test.ts`.

3. **Never assign `listener.context` after constructing an `AudioListener`.**
   Three's constructor builds `gain` on — and connects it to — whatever context
   was global at that moment, so a later re-assignment leaves every
   `PositionalAudio` rendering into a graph nobody hears. Use
   `AudioContext.setContext(unlocked)` *before* `new AudioListener()`.
   → `audio-listener.ts`, `audio-listener.test.ts`.

And one that is easy to *omit*: **`startSession()` (the recording slice) must be
dispatched before the GPS watch starts**, or the GPS coordinator never feeds
alignment, no waypoint ever anchors, and the tour shows nothing forever. With
the default `NullStorageBackend` nothing is written anywhere — the dispatch is
purely what turns GPS fixes into alignment input. AnchorStarter carries the same
call for the same reason.

## Failure states, by design

| Situation                                    | What the visitor sees                                                |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No `?tour=`                                  | "No tour link" — scan the QR / open the shared link. No retry.        |
| CORS-blocked, 404, or a share *page* URL      | Named cause + what to fix, with a retry that re-opens the tour.       |
| Corrupt zip / invalid `tour.json`             | "This tour file is damaged" — **no** retry; retrying cannot fix it.   |
| No WebXR on this device                      | Enter AR disabled, honest message, **map still usable**.              |
| Permission denied / `initAR` failure          | Inline reason on the entry screen, still retryable.                    |
| Alignment not converged yet                  | The framework's own coaching ("walk a few metres"), no empty camera.  |
| Session ended by the system back gesture      | Back to the entry screen with tour, progress and warm cache intact.   |
| Story audio blocked                           | HUD notice asking for one tap.                                        |
| Map tiles unreachable (offline)               | One-shot notice; stops, position and statuses keep working.           |

## Tests

- `ar-seams.test.ts` — the geo→world math against the framework's own
  primitives, plus the two blockers above.
- `audio-listener.test.ts` — asserts `listener.gain.context`, the assertion the
  wrong idiom fails.
- `progress-store.test.ts` — round-trip, corrupt values, private-mode throws.
- `viewing-app.test.ts` (jsdom) — the screen sequence and every failure state,
  with the real gate and the real store. `openRemoteTour` is substituted here
  because the loader's own integration suite already drives it against a real
  range-serving server, and the replay e2e below drives the real one end to end.
- `viewing-replay.e2e.test.ts` — **the §2.4 composed-flow test**: component 5
  packs a real zip, a real HTTP server serves it with real 206/Range, component
  6 opens it for real, and a real Task 1 walk is played through the real store,
  proximity machine and orchestrator. Asserts the knights that appear are
  exactly those the route reaches (the near-miss at 17 m prefetches but never
  appears), ordering is build-before-show, visited matches, and outstanding
  asset references return to zero.

Run: `pnpm exec vitest run src/app/viewing/` (fast) or `pnpm test` (full gate).

## Device checklist (what the machine cannot prove)

The replay e2e substitutes the rendering layer and, with it, GPS anchoring —
a real `GpsAnchor` needs an alignment matrix that only exists inside a session.
So `initAR` + `enableArWorldGroupAlignment` + `createGpsAnchor` wiring is proven
by hand. Walk this list on an Android/Chrome phone, outdoors, against a tour
authored with Authoring mode:

1. Scan the QR from the pack-and-share panel → the tour opens (name + stop count).
2. Grant camera + location → Start → Enter AR.
3. Coaching appears; **nothing spawns at the origin** while it does.
4. Walk toward a waypoint: it appears at roughly its active radius, not before.
5. Tap it → the story is **audible** and the transcript shows.
6. Toggle the map in AR → it composites over the camera feed and tracks you.
7. System back gesture → entry screen, progress kept; re-enter → the nearby
   knight must be re-approached, not already active.
8. Reload the page → visited stops are still visited.
9. Wait for "offline-ready", enable airplane mode → the tour keeps working
   (map tiles degrade with a notice).
