/**
 * Autopilot for the desktop preview: walks the tour's breadcrumb polyline at a
 * constant pace so a tour can be demonstrated without touching the keyboard.
 *
 * Same frame and same pose type as `walk-simulator` (GPS-world NUE metres,
 * heading clockwise from north), so the viewport can swap between manual and
 * automatic locomotion without either side knowing about the other.
 *
 * Two properties matter for real breadcrumbs: leftover distance carries across
 * a vertex (otherwise the pace stutters at every corner of a dense recording),
 * and zero-length segments — which a recording made while standing still is
 * full of — are skipped rather than divided by.
