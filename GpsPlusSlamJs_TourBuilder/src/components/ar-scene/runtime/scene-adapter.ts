/**
 * The `SceneAdapter` port — the single seam between orchestration and rendering
 * (plan A20).
 *
 * Everything in `runtime/` talks to the scene through this interface and never
 * imports THREE at runtime, which is what lets the replay e2e drive the real
 * store, the real proximity driver and the real orchestrator against a fake
 * adapter — in Node, with no WebGL. `view/three-scene-adapter.ts` is the one
 * real implementation.
 *
 * Handles are deliberately opaque. A port that handed back `THREE.Object3D`
 * would leak the rendering layer straight back into the orchestrator and buy
 * nothing.
 *
 * `Vector3` is imported **type-only** (the same trick component 4's pure core
 * uses): positions are produced by the adapter and passed through, never
 * constructed here, so `runtime/` carries zero runtime dependency on THREE.
 *
 * @see plans/2026-07-31-ar-scene-plan.md §4.3
