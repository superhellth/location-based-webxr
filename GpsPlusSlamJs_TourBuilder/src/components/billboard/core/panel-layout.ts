/**
 * Pure layout + hit-mapping for the in-world transport panel.
 *
 * The panel is a textured plane (a `CanvasTexture`) showing a play/stop button
 * and a horizontal progress bar. This module is the one place that knows *where*
 * those controls live on the panel — expressed as normalized rectangles in the
 * plane's UV space — so the same layout both draws the panel and decides what a
 * tap means. That keeps the interaction correct by construction and free of any
 * renderer: the view raycasts the panel, reads the hit UV, and asks
 * `hitToAction` what to dispatch.
 *
 * The result is a ready-to-dispatch `TransportAction` (`toggle` or `seek`) —
 * an earlier separate "intent" type was an identity mapping away from the
 * action union, so every caller re-wrote the same pass-through switch.
 *
 * UV convention matches `THREE.PlaneGeometry` intersection UVs: origin (0,0) is
 * the bottom-left of the front face, u → right, v → up.
