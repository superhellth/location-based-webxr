/**
 * `packTour` — bundle a tour + its asset bytes into an uncompressed `tour.zip`
 * (Component 5, the authoring-side export step).
 *
 * Thin adapter over the framework's generic `packFilesAsZip`: this file owns
 * only the tour-specific parts — resolving `AssetId`s to `File`s and mapping
 * `Tour` into the framework's manifest/entry shape. ZIP mechanics (store mode,
 * entry-path safety) live in `gps-plus-slam-app-framework/storage`.
 *
 * Scope: this does NOT validate the tour schema — the caller's `Tour` is typed
 * and normally comes from `selectExportedTour`. It DOES validate asset
 * coverage (every declared asset has bytes), because that failure is
 * invisible in the artifact rather than caught by the type system.
 *
 * @see plans/Shared-Contract.md §1 (schema + Invariant 3)
 * @see plans/2026-07-14-packaging-plan.md (decisions 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 14)
