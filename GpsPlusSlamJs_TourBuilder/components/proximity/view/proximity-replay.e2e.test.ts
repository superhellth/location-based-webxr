/**
 * Replay e2e (TASK.md §2.3 component 4, second test level): feed a REAL outdoor
 * walk recorded in Task 1 through the pure machine and assert the zone
 * transitions behave correctly on genuinely noisy GPS+IMU data — deterministic,
 * on a desktop, no phone (plan Q9 "replay-then-iterate").
 *
 * We replay the recording once, take the user's ordered world-space path
 * (`odometryPositions`), synthesize waypoint anchors *from that same path* so the
 * whole test lives in one self-consistent metric frame (plan Q10 — no alignment
 * matrix, no geo math needed; distance is rigid-transform-invariant), then feed
 * every sample through `createProximityDriver` — the exact impure half the
 * composed app runs, with its default movement-epsilon gate live. That the
 * assertions below hold with the gate enabled is the proof the gate is
 * behaviour-preserving on real GPS noise, not just on synthetic poses.
 *
 * The assertions are geometry-derived, not hand-tuned (plan Q11):
 *  - **deepest zone reached == what the real minimum distance implies** — proves
 *    a pass-through waypoint reaches ACTIVE, a near-miss reaches only
 *    PREFETCHING, and a far one stays IDLE;
 *  - **no illegal skip** — every emitted edge is between adjacent zones (D15);
 *  - **unimodal zone sequence** — on a single fly-by the zone rank rises then
 *    falls and never bounces back up; this is the no-flicker proof *on real
 *    noise* (the fractional hysteresis band, D16, is what makes it hold);
 *  - **timing (soft)** — ACTIVE is first entered near the sample of closest
 *    approach, within a generous tolerance.
