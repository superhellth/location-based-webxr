/**
 * Bounded parse queue (plan A8).
 *
 * On a dense route several waypoints can cross the 25 m prefetch line in the
 * same update, and `GLTFLoader.parseAsync` runs on the main thread. Firing them
 * all at once re-introduces exactly the frame-rate stutter the PREFETCH zone
 * exists to prevent (TASK §2.5.3), so at most `concurrency` tasks run at a time
 * and the rest wait in FIFO order.
 *
 * `drain()` is the disposal path: queued-but-not-started tasks are dropped and
 * their promises rejected with a `QueueDrainedError`, which the caller treats as
 * "this waypoint simply never loaded". Already-running tasks are left to finish
 * — they cannot be cancelled, and the lifecycle's generation guard already makes
 * their late results harmless.
 *
 * @see plans/2026-07-31-ar-scene-plan.md §4.4
