/**
 * Replay e2e (TASK.md §2.3/§2.4, second test level) — the whole AR viewing scene
 * driven by a REAL outdoor walk recorded in Task 1: the real store, the real
 * proximity driver (component 4) and the real orchestrator, with only the
 * rendering layer faked. Deterministic, on a desktop, no phone, no GPU.
 *
 * This is what the `SceneAdapter` port was introduced for (plan A20). Under a
 * plain core/view split the code deciding *when a knight appears* would live in
 * a WebGL file and could not be asserted at all in this package.
 *
 * As in component 4's replay test, waypoint anchors are synthesized FROM the
 * recorded path, so the whole test lives in one self-consistent metric frame and
 * needs no alignment matrix and no geo math. Every assertion below is derived
 * from that geometry — none is hand-tuned:
 *
 *  1. **Ordering (anti-jank).** A visual is instantiated before it is ever shown.
 *  2. **Balance (no leaks).** After the walk + `dispose()`, every clone and
 *     template is gone and outstanding asset references are ZERO.
 *  3. **Agreement with geometry.** The waypoints that became visible are exactly
 *     those whose true minimum horizontal distance dropped below `activeRadius`.
 *  4. **Bounded resources.** Concurrent templates never exceed the LRU capacity
 *     plus the waypoints in flight, and parses never exceed the concurrency cap.
