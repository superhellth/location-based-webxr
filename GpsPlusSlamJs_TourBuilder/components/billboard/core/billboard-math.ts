/**
 * Pure cylindrical-billboard math.
 *
 * A `THREE.Sprite` always fully faces the camera (it tilts and rolls with it).
 * For an upright AR marker we instead use a textured plane and yaw it ourselves
 * around the world Y axis only — a "cylindrical" billboard that turns to face
 * the user horizontally but never pitches or rolls.
 *
 * This module owns the single decision in that behaviour — the Y rotation — and
 * nothing else, so it can be unit-tested with no WebGL/DOM. The view layer
 * applies the result as `mesh.rotation.set(0, yaw, 0)`, which is what
 * guarantees pitch/roll stay exactly 0 (they are never written).
 *
 * Convention: the plane's **+Z** local axis is its front (image) face — the
 * side the texture is seen from. `PlaneGeometry`'s front face has normal +Z, so
 * yawing +Z toward the camera shows the image to the user.
