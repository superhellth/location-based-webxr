/**
 * Pure reconcile step between the transport model and one billboard's player.
 *
 * The subtlest rules of the component live here: when a divergence between the
 * model's playhead and the audio element is a *deliberate jump* (a click
 * restart or a bar seek → issue a seek) versus ordinary ~4 Hz `timeupdate`
 * feedback (→ leave the element alone, or the two would fight), and when a
 * play/pause call must be issued at all. They used to be imperative diffing
 * inside the view's `applyState`; as a pure function they are unit-tested and
 * reused verbatim by component 8's AR scene.
 *
 * The view executes the returned commands mechanically: set panel visibility,
 * seek if `seekToSec` is non-null, then call `play()`/`pause()` per `playback`.
