# components/shared — cross-component building blocks

Small, framework-free modules reused by more than one component demo. This is
**not a runnable component** — it has no `demo.ts` / `index.html`; it is only
imported by the components under `components/*/`.

It exists so shared logic is defined **once** (the gate's jscpd duplication check
forbids copy-pasting ≥50 tokens across components) while keeping each component
independently demoable — importing a shared helper is fine, but one component
importing another component's internals is not.

## Modules

### `billboard-math.ts` — face-the-user math (pure)

`computeBillboardYaw(billboard, camera, fallback = 0)`: the single Y-rotation
(radians) that turns a plane's **+Z front face** toward the camera in the XZ
plane while keeping it upright (pitch/roll never written). Height is ignored by
design; a camera directly overhead returns `fallback`. Used by the clickable
billboard (component 1) and the in-world-text label (component 2). Upstream-PR
candidate (GPS-free, dependency-free).

### `clamp.ts` — `clamp01` (pure)

Clamp a value into the inclusive `[0, 1]` range. Used by the transport reducer's
`seek`, the panel-layout seek mapping (component 1), and text sizing (component 2).

### `panel-geometry.ts` — UV rectangles + hit test (pure)

The `Rect` type (normalized UV space, origin bottom-left per `PlaneGeometry`
intersection UVs) and `contains(rect, u, v)` (edges inclusive). Each component
builds its own `hitTo…Intent` mapping on top of this primitive.

### `canvas-panel.ts` — canvas draw helpers (view)

`toPx(rect, canvasW, canvasH)` converts a UV rect (origin bottom-left) to a
canvas pixel rect (origin top-left); `roundRect(ctx, x, y, w, h, r)` begins a
radius-clamped rounded-rect path. View-layer (touches a canvas context) but
framework-free.

### `resize.ts` — demo window-resize helper (view)

`attachResize(camera, renderer)` keeps a perspective camera + renderer in sync
with the window size. Shared by the component demos so the boilerplate lives once.

### `tap-gate.ts` — tap-vs-drag predicate (pure)

`isTap(down, up)` over `PointerSample` (`{ x, y, timeMs }`): true when the
pointer moved ≤ 5 px and was released within 400 ms — the one decision that
tells a select-tap apart from an OrbitControls camera-drag or a long-press.
Pure so the thresholds are pinned by unit tests.

### `pointer-tap-picker.ts` — tap-gated raycast picking (view)

`createPointerTapPicker({ domElement, camera, getPickTargets, onTap })`: the
DOM listeners + NDC + `Raycaster.intersectObjects` mechanics shared by the
billboard (component 1) and in-world-text (component 2) click interactions.
Tracks a single potential-tap pointer by `pointerId`; a second concurrent
finger (pinch) or a `pointercancel` invalidates the gesture, so no phantom
taps on touch. The tap decision itself is `tap-gate.ts`. Each component's own
`*-interaction.ts` wraps this and interprets the returned `Intersection`'s
`userData` — this module never looks at `userData` itself.

### `demo.css` — shared canvas-demo styles

Base styles for the canvas-overlay demo pages (`:root`, `html/body`,
`#canvas-root`, `#hud`, `#status`) — billboard, in-world-text. Each demo's
`index.html` links it and keeps only component-specific tweaks inline.

### `panel-demo.css` — shared control-panel demo styles

Base styles for the two-column data/control-panel demo pages (`main`, `.cols`,
`section.panel`, `.buttons`, `button`, `pre`, …) — store, packaging. A separate
sheet from `demo.css` because these demos aren't a canvas overlay; each demo's
`index.html` links it and keeps only component-specific tweaks (and any `pre`
`max-height` override) inline.

## Tests

`billboard-math.test.ts`, `panel-geometry.test.ts`, and `tap-gate.test.ts`
cover the pure modules (`clamp.ts` is exercised transitively; the
`canvas-panel.ts` helpers are view-layer and covered via each component's
panel). `pointer-tap-picker.test.ts` covers the stateful picking headlessly —
synthetic pointer events against a fake element, real `Raycaster`/meshes —
pinning the multi-touch/cancel invalidation, the tap-vs-drag/long-press gate
wiring, the client→NDC mapping, and nearest-hit selection. Run `pnpm test:unit`.
