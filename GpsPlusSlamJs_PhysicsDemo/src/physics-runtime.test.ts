/**
 * Headless tests for the shared physics runtime (real Rapier + real THREE).
 *
 * Why this test matters:
 * Both the desktop-replay and live-AR modes drive this one runtime, so its two
 * mode-independent behaviours are pinned here: (1) the collider is rebuilt from
 * the growing mesh only once per throttle window (coalescing the fast grid growth
 * so resting balls are not teleported every frame), and (2) a WORLD-space spawn
 * point is converted into the ball group's local raw-WebXR space via the
 * `WEBXR_TO_NUE` chain — the conversion that makes AR/desktop spawns land where
 * the user pointed and coincide with the reconstructed mesh.
