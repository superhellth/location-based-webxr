/**
 * Recording Options - User-configurable settings for data capture.
 *
 * Allows users to disable/configure high-frequency data streams
 * (depth sampling, image capture) to improve performance on lower-end devices.
 *
 * Options persist in localStorage across sessions.
 *
 * The RECORDER owns this catalog (moved out of the framework's `state/` layer
 * on 2026-07-11, G-1 move — see
 * `GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-07-11-1445-recording-options-altitude-move-plan.md`).
 *
 * **Ownership rule: a group whose TYPE the framework owns is validated by the
 * framework too.** The bounds of `motionFilter.maxAngularVelocity` or
 * `qualityFilter.blurRelativeThreshold` are statements about what those gates
 * do, not about this app, so the constraint tables and validators live with the
 * gates and are consumed here. This catalog only declares the bounds of the
 * groups it actually owns. Framework-owned groups consumed here:
 * - `arCrashIsolation` — type/defaults/validator from
 *   `gps-plus-slam-app-framework/ar/ar-crash-isolation` (the framework reads
 *   the flags in `webxr-session.ts`).
 * - `images.motionFilter` — from `ar/capture-motion-gate` (the gate that
 *   consumes the thresholds); its constraints are re-exported below.
 * - `images.qualityFilter` — from `ar/image-quality` (likewise).
 * - `OccluderDebugStyle` (+ its values array) from
 *   `gps-plus-slam-app-framework/visualization/occlusion-mesh` (the consumer
 *   of the style); re-exported below for recorder callers.
 *
 * The per-group validators below are spec tables over the framework's
 * `validateOptionFields`, which makes them exhaustive over their group type:
 * adding a field to an options interface is a compile error until its
 * validation is declared.
