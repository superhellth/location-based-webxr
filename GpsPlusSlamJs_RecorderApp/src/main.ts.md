# main.ts

## Purpose

Application entry point. Initializes WebXR, wires up UI callbacks, and orchestrates the recording workflow.

## Public API

This module is the entry point that runs on page load. It also exports the following for the soft-reset flow and testing:

| Export                                   | Type                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `resetForNewRecording()`                 | `async () => void`       | Orchestrates soft reset: tears down current session (store, trackers, sync, map), creates fresh store, resets storage/UI state, and checks if read folder permission is still granted. |
| `getImportedRefPoints()`                 | `() => KnownGeoAnchor[]` | Returns the sidecar-imported known anchors (entries with `timestamp === 0`) from the flat `refPoints` slice via `selectImportedKnownAnchors`. Test-only seam.                          |
| `setImportedRefPointsForTesting(points)` | `(points) => void`       | Dispatches `setImportedRefPointEntries` into the flat `refPoints` slice; each input becomes a `RefPointEntry` with `timestamp: 0` (sidecar marker). Test-only.                         |
| `setCurrentScenarioName(name)`           | `(string) => void`       | Sets current scenario name (test-only).                                                                                                                                                |

## Internal Flow

1. **Check WebXR support** - Exits early with error if unsupported
2. **Initialize UI** - Wires up button callbacks to handler functions
3. **Initialize Session Summary** - Wires up summary panel callbacks
4. **Handle folder selection** - Calls `initStorage()`, populates scenario dropdown
5. **Handle Enter AR** - Calls `initAR()` to start WebXR session
6. **Handle recording controls** - Start/stop recording, mark reference points
7. **Handle stop recording** - Collects summary data and shows Session Summary panel

## Invariants & Assumptions

- Runs in a browser with potential WebXR support
- DOM elements exist in `index.html` (buttons, modals, etc.)
- File System Access API available (Chrome Android 142+)
- **Navigation store getter**: `initNavigation` receives `() => store` (not `store` directly) so that after soft reset the navigation module always resolves the current store instance (Bug 9 fix).
- **Reference point counts**: When displaying reference point info in status messages,
  always distinguish between unique reference points (`refPointDefs.length`) and
  total observations (`flattenRefPointsToMarks(refPointDefs).length`). Use format:
  `"N ref points (M observations)"` to avoid confusion.
- **Best-effort AR scene layers**: the frame-tile visualizer (F3.5d) and the
  occupancy-grid cubes (2026-06-11 depth occupancy-grid port plan, Iter 5) are
  each wired after `initAR` inside their own `try/catch` — a failure logs a
  warning and recording continues without that layer. Both are torn down in
  `resetMainState()` (unsubscribe + dispose; the occupancy grid itself is a
  plain in-memory structure dropped with its reference). **They are also
  disposed on re-entry**: `handleEnterAR` runs again on every "back to setup →
  Enter AR" cycle and `onBackToSetup` performs no teardown, so each block first
  disposes-and-nulls its prior subscriber + visualizer before constructing new
  ones — otherwise the orphaned `storeRef` swap-listener (registered by
  `wireOccupancyGridSubscribers`) and the previous visualizer's GPU resources
  would leak (same leak class the tracking-quality subscription guards inline).
  The cube visualizer
  is parented under `arWorldGroup` (NOT the scene root): the grid's cells are
  raw-WebXR coordinates that must ride the alignment matrix like the camera
  (port plan Iter 7 reparenting fix).
- **Live QR recording + debug viz** (opt-in, `recording-options.qr.enabled`;
  recorder live-QR WS-2/WS-5). When enabled, `handleEnterAR` registers the
  camera-frame callback **before** `initAR` (`setCameraFrameCallback`, forwarding
  frames to the producer held in `qrProducer`) and, after AR init inside its own
  best-effort `try/catch`, calls `wireQrRecording` (under `arWorldGroup`) to build
  the thin RAW producer + the WS-5 debug axis+cube subscriber. Torn down in
  `resetMainState()` and disposed-first on re-entry (same leak-guard pattern as
  the occupancy/frame-tile layers). See
  [qr/wire-qr-recording.ts.md](qr/wire-qr-recording.ts.md). Disabled by default,
  so an existing recording is byte-for-byte unaffected.
- **Live debug-overlay toggles** (`recording-options.visualization.*`, Finding B
  of the [2026-06-14 follow-up](../../../gps-plus-slam/GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-06-14-followup-frame-tile-legacy-aspect-and-live-toggle.md)):
  `handleEnterAR` reads the four toggles ONCE at Enter-AR (toggling mid-session
  applies on the next Enter-AR; replay is never gated). Each uses the mechanism
  that fits its consumer:
  - **frameTiles** / **compassCubes** — skipped entirely when off (no
    non-visual consumer; the frame-blob cache is filled in
    `handleImageCaptured`, independent of the tile wiring). The frame-tile
    teardown still runs unconditionally so turning it off cleanly removes a
    prior cycle's tiles.
  - **gpsAlignmentMarkers** — NOT skipped; `gpsEventVisualizer.setVisible(flag)`
    only hides the spheres, because their alignment-snapshot positions feed the
    session-summary map at stop.
  - **occupancyCubes** — gates only the rendered cube `InstancedMesh`. The
    `OccupancyGrid` is **always** built, published via `setOccupancyGrid`, and
    fed by `wireOccupancyGridSubscribers`, because the COLMAP export and other
    non-visualizer consumers read it through `getOccupancyGrid()`. When off, the
    wirer gets a no-op visualizer sink so the grid still folds in every depth
    sample without allocating GPU geometry.

## Examples

The module self-executes:

```typescript
// In browser, automatically runs main() on import
import './main';
```

## Tests

- Unit tests in `main.test.ts` — 32 tests covering:
  - Store creation, AR flow, recording lifecycle
  - Session summary data collection
  - Progress tracking (frame/action counters)
  - Reference point deduplication (imported + scenario)
  - **Soft reset** (Issue 4): 5 tests for `resetForNewRecording()`:
    - Calls all cleanup functions (hideSessionSummary, resetForNewSession, etc.)
    - Creates a fresh store
    - Keeps folder when read permission still granted
    - Clears folder + imported ref points when permission lost
    - Graceful handling of permission check returning false
- E2E tests in `playwright-tests/smoke.spec.js` verify the page loads
- E2E tests in `playwright-tests/session-summary.spec.js` verify post-recording summary
