# `colmap-zip-contributor.ts`

## Purpose

Recorder-side `ZipExportContributor` that derives a COLMAP `sparse/0/` model
from the live recording state and writes it into the exported ZIP. The
integration seam tying together Iter 1 (conversions), Iter 2 (serializers) and
Iter 2.5 (grid accessor). See
[2026-06-13-colmap-export-plan.md](../../../../gps-plus-slam/GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-06-13-colmap-export-plan.md)
Iter 3.

## Public API

- `createColmapZipContributor(deps): ZipExportContributor`
  - `deps.getFrames(): readonly ArImageCapture[]` — WebXR camera poses + JPEG
    pixel dims (wired to `selectFrameTilesInWebXR(store.getState())`).
  - `deps.getProjectionMatrix(): Matrix4 | undefined` — session-constant
    intrinsics (wired to `state.recording.latestDepthSample?.projectionMatrix`).
  - `deps.getOccupancyGrid(): OccupancyGrid | null` — the shared live grid (Iter
    2.5 provider).
  - Returns a contributor with `subdir: 'sparse'` that writes
    `0/cameras.txt`, `0/images.txt`, `0/points3D.txt` (file count 3), or **0
    files** when intrinsics are unavailable.

## Behavior & invariants

- **Reads injected live state, never re-parses `actions/`** (Q2) — per-sync cost
  ∝ output size, not O(session²).
- **Q4 skip:** returns 0 files (no `sparse/0/`) when `getProjectionMatrix()` is
  `undefined`, when no frame carries pixel dimensions, or when the matrix is not
  a usable perspective. The rest of the ZIP is unaffected.
- **NAME = bare filename** (`images/frame-000001.jpg` → `frame-000001.jpg`); the
  user points COLMAP `image_path` at the ZIP's `images/`. Legacy `frames/`
  prefixes are stripped the same way.
- **Point source:** each `points3D` row is the **exact per-cell surface point**
  (`getCellPoint(cell) ?? getCellCenter(cell)`, follow-up Item A) — the
  running-average of the measured points in the cell, hugging the real surface
  instead of snapping to the 15 cm lattice.
- **World frame:** points are passed to `points3D` untransformed — raw WebXR
  world IS the COLMAP world (Iter-1 camera-only basis change), so points and
  cameras stay registered.
- **Color fallback:** cells with no observed RGB (`getCellColor` → null) emit
  mid-gray `128 128 128` rather than black.
- **Empty grid:** still emits a valid model (cameras + images) with an empty
  `points3D.txt`.

## Known: scene loads upside-down (manual fix)

The exported world is raw-WebXR **+Y-up**; COLMAP/3DGS viewers (Lichtfeld
Studio, etc.) conventionally treat the world as **+Y-down gravity**, so the
reconstruction loads **upside-down** (otherwise consistent — not mirrored, not
mis-scaled). **Fix in the viewer: rotate the splat 180° about the X axis.** This
is a deliberate decision (follow-up Item B, Q-B1) to keep the export untouched
rather than fold a world transform into every file; the analysis of the
in-export fix (a shared `G = diag(1,−1,−1)` world basis change) is recorded in
the follow-up plan should we ever want upright-by-default.

## Wiring

Added to `buildZipContributors()` in `recording-session-handlers.ts`, used by
BOTH the periodic crash-safety sync (`syncToExternalZip`) and the final
`exportSessionAsZip`, so the on-disk backup is continuously COLMAP-format.

## Tests

- `colmap-zip-contributor.test.ts` — happy path (3 files, PINHOLE dims, RGB
  point), bare-filename NAME (incl. legacy `frames/`), Q4 skips (no matrix / no
  dims → 0 files), empty-grid valid model, gray fallback. Wiring is covered by
  the recording-session-handlers tests.
