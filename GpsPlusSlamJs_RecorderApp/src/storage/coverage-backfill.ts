/**
 * Coverage Backfill — one-time in-zip upgrade (Slice B, O3 = in-zip rewrite).
 *
 * Rewrites legacy recordings so they carry their H3 coverage in `session.json`,
 * making them index instantly on every future open in this app and any other
 * reader. The coverage cells were already derived in memory while the map
 * browser streamed its index (Slice A), so this step only *writes* them — it
 * never re-reads GPS paths.
 *
 * Safety (this mutates the user's files):
 *   - **Opt-in + confirmed (B1):** the caller invokes this only from an explicit,
 *     confirmed user gesture — never as a side effect of opening a folder.
 *   - **Permission (B2):** upgrades the folder handle to `readwrite` on entry;
 *     if denied it writes nothing and reports `permissionDenied` so the caller
 *     can degrade gracefully (the progressive in-memory index still works).
 *   - **Verify-before-overwrite (B4):** each rewritten zip is produced in memory
 *     by `embedCoverageInSessionJson` and its `session.json` is re-read to
 *     confirm coverage landed BEFORE the original is touched. The actual write
 *     uses `FileSystemFileHandle.createWritable()`, which the File System Access
 *     spec implements as write-to-temp + **atomic swap on `close()`** — so a
 *     crash mid-write leaves the original intact. This replaces the plan's
 *     manual `<name>.h3.tmp` sibling (which needed per-file parent-directory
 *     handles and left litter): the in-memory verify is stronger and the
 *     browser already gives us the atomic rename the plan assumed absent.
 *   - **Isolated failures:** one bad file is counted and skipped; the rest run.
