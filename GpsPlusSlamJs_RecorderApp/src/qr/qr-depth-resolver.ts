/**
 * As-of depth resolver for the recorder live-QR debug viz (WS-5).
 *
 * The derive-on-read size join (`ar/qr-derived-pose.ts`) needs, for each QR
 * detection, the depth-sampling context that was active **at that detection's
 * timestamp**. The recorder records depth in its own stream (`recordDepthSample`),
 * but the store only keeps the LATEST sample — so this module keeps a small,
 * bounded history of depth samples and answers `resolveDepthAt(timestamp)` with
 * the sample whose timestamp is the latest `≤ timestamp` (the as-of join). It
 * then builds the {@link QrSizeDepthContext} the size measurer consumes
 * (unprojector + bilinear grid lookup), exactly like the QR demo's live
 * `getDepthContext`, but time-addressed.
 *
 * This is the **one genuinely new piece** WS-5 needs. It runs identically live
 * and on replay: `append` is fed every recorded depth sample (live: the capture
 * callback; replay: the re-dispatched `recordDepthSample` reflected in the
 * store's `latestDepthSample`), so the join reproduces the live result.
 *
 * **Clock domain (load-bearing):** depth timestamps are `performance.now()`
 * (relative), and the QR producer MUST stamp detections from the same clock
 * (plan open topic A). The lookup is a pure numeric `≤` over those stamps; if the
 * QR producer used epoch ms instead, every join would silently miss.
 *
 * @see gps-plus-slam-app-framework/ar/qr-derived-pose — the consumer of `resolveDepthAt`.
 * @see qr-debug-controller.ts — drives `append` + renders the derived placement.
