/**
 * Recording Coverage Index
 *
 * Builds the in-memory index that backs the map-centric recording browser:
 * for every recording in a folder, the deduplicated res-11 H3 cells its GPS
 * path crossed. The map view then clusters these per zoom level (via
 * `clusterCellsByZoom`) to draw tiles and answer "which tours cross this tile?".
 *
 * Coverage comes from one of two sources (D2 — in-memory only, no disk cache):
 *   1. The recording's `session.json` `h3Cells` field, read during metadata
 *      discovery — cheap, no GPS unzip (new recordings, Step 2).
 *   2. A legacy fallback: recordings that predate the `h3Cells` field have their
 *      GPS path read from the zip (`loadGpsPathFromBlob`) and coverage derived
 *      in memory (`gpsPathToCoverageCells`). Still no disk persistence — the
 *      persistent cache (2-B) is the documented escape hatch only if real
 *      folders prove too slow to re-scan.
 *
 * @see GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-06-14-map-centric-recording-browser-and-h3-index-user-feedback.md (D2)
