# settings-modal.ts

## Purpose

UI component for the settings modal dialog. Allows users to configure recording options (depth sampling, image capture, occupancy, visualization, compass debug, QR, …) with sliders, checkboxes and selects.

## Architecture: declarative option↔DOM binding

The per-control wiring is a data table, `OPTION_BINDINGS` — one entry per form control with its element id, `RecordingOptions` accessors (`get`/`set`), slider `range` (sourced from the validation `*_CONSTRAINTS`, in slider units), optional model↔slider unit conversion (`toSlider`/`fromSlider`, used by the cm↔m voxel size), label `format`, and an `enabledWhen` gating rule. A small engine consumes the table:

- `bindOptionControls()` (from `initSettingsModal`) resolves each entry against the DOM (`instanceof`-checked; a missing/wrong-typed element logs a warning and stays inert), applies slider min/max/step once, and attaches the listener (`input` for sliders, `change` for checkboxes/selects).
- `populateForm(options)` pushes values + labels into every bound control.
- `refreshControlStates()` re-evaluates every `enabledWhen` after any control event and after populate. Gating reads the **DOM state** of the controlling checkboxes (not the working copy) so it stays evaluable while the modal is hidden — pinned by the compass-gating tests.

**Adding an option = one table entry + the HTML** (control + `${id}-value` label for sliders). Never hand-write a handler/populate pair. A typo'd id fails the binding-completeness test (see Tests) instead of shipping a dead control.

### Functions

| Function                                 | Input               | Output                     | Description                                       |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `initSettingsModal(callback?, clearCb?)` | `(options) => void` | `void`                     | Initializes modal, binds the table, wires buttons |
| `showSettingsModal()`                    | -                   | `void`                     | Shows modal, loads current options                |
| `hideSettingsModal()`                    | -                   | `void`                     | Hides modal, discards unsaved changes             |
| `isSettingsModalVisible()`               | -                   | `boolean`                  | Check if modal is currently shown                 |
| `getWorkingOptions()`                    | -                   | `RecordingOptions \| null` | Get current unsaved options (for testing)         |
| `getOptionBindingIdsForTesting()`        | -                   | `{id, kind}[]`             | Table ids/kinds for the binding-completeness test |

> **Note:** HTML markup lives in `index.html`. Tests use `../test-utils/html-fixtures.ts` to load production HTML, ensuring tests always match the actual UI.

## Invariants & Assumptions

- Modal starts with `hidden` class applied
- Changes are only persisted on Save, not on close/backdrop click
- Sliders are disabled when their parent toggle is unchecked (`enabledWhen` rules in `OPTION_BINDINGS`)
- Slider min/max/step are applied ONCE at init from the validation constraints — one source of truth, so the UI can never offer a value the validator would clamp away
- Slider inputs that parse non-finite are dropped (never written into the working copy); save-time validation remains the authoritative clamp
- Compass gating (`compassPriorConsumerOn`/`compassExperimentOff` rules, 2026-07-20 settings-clarity §4.2/§4.6): the vote-weight slider is disabled unless the experiment or Stage C is checked; Stage C is disabled while the experiment is on. A greyed-out Stage C **keeps its stored value and both flags keep being persisted/recorded** (keep-value-record-both) — disabling is a UI affordance, never a value change. See `GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-07-20-0549-compass-debug-settings-ui-clarity-followup.md`.
- Working copy is created on show, cleared on hide
- Callback is invoked only after successful save
- The voxel-size slider operates in **centimetres** for readability, but the stored option (`occupancy.cellSizeM`) is **metres** — the binding's `fromSlider` divides by 100 and `toSlider` multiplies by 100. A unit mismatch here would feed the grid a 100× wrong cell size, so both directions are unit-tested. Changing it takes effect on the next Enter-AR / replay load (the grid reads it at construction), not mid-session. See [recording-options.ts.md](../state/recording-options.ts.md).
- Build version label (`#build-version-label`) is populated during `initSettingsModal()` from `getBuildInfo()`. If metadata is unavailable, the modal logs a warning and shows `Build unavailable` instead of throwing.
- The `occupancy-occluder-radius` slider writes `workingOptions.occupancy.occluderRadiusM` (Step 2 of the 2026-07-03 fps plan): the camera-local persistent-occluder window (default 25 m; `0` renders as "unlimited" — the pre-Step-2 behaviour). Applies at the next Enter-AR / replay load like the other occupancy knobs.
- The `frame-tile-max-tiles` slider writes `workingOptions.frameTileDisplay.maxTiles` (Step 4 of the [2026-07-03 long-session fps plan](../../../../gps-plus-slam/GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-07-03-1344-long-session-fps-and-voxel-grid-scaling-plan.md)): the **live-only** FIFO cap on rendered frame tiles (default 100; `0` renders as the label "unlimited"). Replay is never capped (full-path coverage auditing) — the help text says so. Applies at the next Enter-AR like the other frame-tile settings.
- The `qr-*` controls write `workingOptions.qr.*` (recorder live-QR WS-2/WS-5). QR is **opt-in** — `qr-enabled` defaults OFF and the interval/capture sliders are disabled until it is checked (mirrors the depth/images gating). `qr-interval` is **ms** and `qr-capture-size` is **px** (both stored as-is, no unit conversion). Read once at the next Enter-AR. See [recording-options.ts.md](../state/recording-options.ts.md) and [qr/wire-qr-recording.ts.md](../qr/wire-qr-recording.ts.md).
- The `viz-*` checkboxes write `workingOptions.visualization.*` (overlays all default ON). They gate **only** what is drawn live during recording — they never change capture, and replay is never gated. The recorder reads them once at the next Enter-AR (`handleEnterAR`), so toggling mid-session has no retroactive effect. Section heading **"Show during recording (3D debug overlays)"** with the note that they only change the live view (DB-3). Exception: `viz-stats-overlay` (`visualization.statsOverlay`, default **OFF**) shows the Stats.js perf panels and **also applies to replay** (Step 0 of the [2026-07-03 long-session fps plan](../../../../gps-plus-slam/GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-07-03-1344-long-session-fps-and-voxel-grid-scaling-plan.md)); its help text notes the dom-overlay dependency (with `arCrashIsolation.enableDomOverlay` off it cannot composite in AR). See [recording-options.ts.md](../state/recording-options.ts.md) and the [2026-06-14 follow-up](../../../../gps-plus-slam/GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-06-14-0012-frame-tile-legacy-aspect-and-live-toggle-followup.md) (Finding B).

## Examples

```typescript
import { initSettingsModal, showSettingsModal } from './settings-modal';

// Initialize with optional change callback
initSettingsModal((options) => {
  console.log('Options saved:', options);
  // Apply new options to capture systems
});

// Open modal (e.g., from a button click)
document
  .getElementById('btn-settings')
  .addEventListener('click', showSettingsModal);
```

## Tests

- `settings-modal.test.ts` — 137 unit tests
  - Binding-table completeness: every `OPTION_BINDINGS` id resolves to the right element kind (checkbox/range/select) in production HTML, and every slider has its `${id}-value` label — a typo'd table id fails here instead of shipping a dead control
  - Production HTML validation: modal and button markup from `index.html`
  - Modal visibility: show/hide behavior
  - Form population: checkboxes, sliders, selects (incl. legacy-field migrations)
  - Slider interactions: value updates + label formats on input
  - Gating: parent-toggle → sub-control disabling, incl. the compass rules
  - Save/reset/close behavior and persistence round-trips
  - Build label population and graceful fallback when metadata is unavailable

> Tests use `html-fixtures.ts` to load the actual production HTML from `index.html`, eliminating duplication and ensuring tests fail if the production markup is broken.
