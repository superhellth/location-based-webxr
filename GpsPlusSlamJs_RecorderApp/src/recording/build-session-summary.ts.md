# build-session-summary.ts

## Purpose

Pure builder that derives the end-of-recording `SessionSummaryData` (shown by `../ui/session-summary.ts`) from explicit inputs. Extracted from `performStop` in `recording-session-handlers.ts` so the summary math and field mapping are testable without the recording-lifecycle mock forest.

## Public API

- `buildSessionSummary(inputs: SessionSummaryInputs): SessionSummaryData`
  - Pure: no I/O, no store access, no module-singleton reads, no input mutation. Same inputs ⇒ same output.
  - Error modes: none of its own — it trusts the caller-validated inputs (see invariants). `calcGpsCoords`/`computeFusedPath` require the gps-plus-slam-js license to be active, which the app guarantees at startup (tests activate `COMMUNITY_LICENSE_KEY`).
- `SessionSummaryInputs` (interface) — everything `performStop` used to close over:
  - `endTime` / `startTime` — epoch ms; `startTime` is `undefined` when `sessionMetadata` was inconsistent at stop, and the duration then falls back to `endTime` (≈ 0 duration rather than an epoch-length one).
  - `imageCount`, `depthSampleCount`, `errors`, `failedWriteCount` — passed through verbatim (the `errors` array is the same reference, not a copy).
  - `gpsPositions` — raw GPS points (`gpsEvents.gpsPositions`); source of `gpsEventCount`, `firstGps`/`lastGps`, `rawGpsPath`, and the `zeroRef` used for all NUE→GPS conversions.
  - `odometryPositions`, `alignmentMatrix` — NUE odometry path + solver matrix; feed `totalDistanceMeters` and `computeFusedPath`.
  - `alignmentSnapshotNuePositions` — caller reads `gpsEventVisualizer.getAlignmentSnapshotPositions()`; mapped to GPS only when a `zeroRef` exists (Issue #1).
  - `refPoints` — recorder `refPoints` slice entries; mapped via the shared `refPointEntriesToMarkerData` so summary map and live minimap plot identical markers (2026-07-05 live-map feedback).
  - `syncResult`, `zipFilename` — final sync / OPFS ZIP export result; the caller resolves the filename only when a result exists, and the builder defensively re-guards (`undefined` without a ZIP).
- `SummaryGpsPoint` (type) — `Pick<GpsPoint, 'latitude' | 'longitude' | 'latLongAccuracy' | 'zeroRef'>`; the narrow slice the summary reads, so state's full `GpsPoint[]` is assignable while tests construct only four fields.

## Invariants & assumptions

- `totalDistanceMeters` = sum of 3D Euclidean segment lengths over `odometryPositions`; 0 for empty/single-point paths. Translation-invariant and additive under concatenation (pinned by property tests).
- `alignmentSnapshotPath` is `[]` when there is no GPS fix (no `zeroRef` ⇒ no NUE→GPS mapping exists); otherwise each NUE position is converted with `calcGpsCoords` against the FIRST GPS point's `zeroRef` and renamed `lon → lng` for Leaflet.
- `rawGpsPath` includes `accuracy` only when `latLongAccuracy` is a number `> 0` (0/undefined are omitted so the map draws no bogus circles).
- Positions are NUE tuples (`[north, up, east]` meters); matrices are the library's column-major `Matrix4` tuples.
- Defensive posture: inputs come from the recorder's own store/trackers (already validated at their boundaries), so the builder does not re-validate; the only re-guard is `zipFilename` (never surfaced without `syncResult`).

## Example

```typescript
import { buildSessionSummary } from './build-session-summary';

const summaryData = buildSessionSummary({
  endTime: Date.now(),
  startTime: sessionMetadata?.startTime,
  imageCount,
  depthSampleCount,
  errors,
  failedWriteCount: state.recording.failedWriteCount,
  gpsPositions,
  odometryPositions: gpsEvents?.odometryPositions ?? [],
  alignmentMatrix: gpsEvents?.alignmentMatrix ?? null,
  alignmentSnapshotNuePositions:
    gpsEventVisualizer.getAlignmentSnapshotPositions(),
  refPoints,
  syncResult: lastSyncResult,
  zipFilename: lastSyncResult
    ? (getSaveFileName() ?? generateSessionFilename())
    : undefined,
});
showSessionSummary(summaryData);
```

## Tests

- `build-session-summary.test.ts` — distance integration (multi-segment 3-4-5+12 path, empty/single-point → 0), NUE→GPS snapshot mapping against the REAL `calcGpsCoords` (the handler suite mocks it) incl. the missing-zeroRef gate, and assembly of every remaining field (duration fallback, first/last GPS, `rawGpsPath` accuracy gating, fused path with identity/null matrix, ref-point mapping, ZIP fields with/without a sync result).
- `build-session-summary.property.test.ts` — distance non-negativity, translation invariance, and concatenation additivity; `rawGpsPath` count/order preservation.
- The caller-side wiring (that `performStop` feeds the right closure values in) stays covered by `recording-session-handlers.test.ts`.
