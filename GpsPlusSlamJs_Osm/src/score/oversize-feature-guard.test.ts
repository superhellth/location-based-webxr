/**
 * What bounds `scoreChunks` when a feature is larger than the map?
 *
 * WHY THIS TEST EXISTS. `buildFeatureIndex` carries an explicit oversize guard —
 * `MAX_CELLS_PER_FEATURE` with `estimateCellCount` in front of it — and its
 * docstring says why: unbounded covering "fails two different ways on real
 * data", a merely-huge feature grinding (measured there: an unrestricted index
 * over the building-block fixture did not finish in TEN MINUTES) and a
 * genuinely continental one THROWING out of `polygonToCellsExperimental`.
 *
 * `AffordanceIndex.scoreChunks` is the path production actually runs, and it
 * does **not** go through `buildFeatureIndex`. It clips each feature to the
 * batch's union bounding box and calls `coverCells` directly — no estimate, no
 * budget, no `failed` list. Nothing had ever fed it an oversize feature: the
 * bench and the index tests use `park`, `street-corner` and `building-block`,
 * while `beach` — a single relation holding the entire North Sea, and per
 * `testdata/README.md` a shape that "will recur on every coastal tile" — was
 * only ever pointed at the guarded path. The absence was invisible by
 * construction, which is the only reason it is worth a test.
 *
 * ## The answer: the CLIP is the bound, and it holds
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-13 on the `beach` fixture (i7-1185G7). Scoring a radius-4
 * disc around the fixture centre with the North Sea as the only feature:
 *
 * - the batch's selection box is **488 m** across, ~131 000 m² of chunk against
 *   ~238 000 m² of box — a ratio of **1.812**, which is what a hexagonal disc's
 *   bounding box plus a shared margin costs, and is the amortisation
 *   `scoreChunks` claims in as many words;
 * - that box holds **5 417** res-13 cells. Covering the North Sea clipped to it
 *   produces **4 409** — the coast crosses the box, so the water is ~81 % of it
 *   — of which **2 177** land in a scored chunk and are kept;
 * - `update` completes in **93 ms**, geometry converted once.
 *
 * The three cell counts are different quantities and an earlier draft of this
 * header used one figure for all of them. 5 417 is the box's CAPACITY, 4 409 is
 * the cover actually computed (`stats.cellsCovered`), 2 177 is what survives the
 * per-chunk filter. Only the middle one is work done and then discarded.
 *
 * So the guard's absence is survivable **because the clip is doing the guard's
 * job**, not because the case cannot arise. That distinction is the finding:
 * the bound is a consequence of the scored disc's size, and nothing states it.
 *
 * ## A retracted figure, recorded rather than quietly fixed
 *
 * The first version of this file computed the box's cell count against
 * **0.895 m²** and reported 265 726 res-13 cells and a ~89× waste ratio. That
 * is the res-**15** average area; res 13 is `AFFORDANCE_CELL_AREA_M2` = 43.9 m².
 * The real count is ~5 400 and the real ratio ~1.8×, so the alarming version of
 * this test was wrong by 49× and its conclusion — an unguarded blow-up on the
 * live path — does not hold. Kept here because the mistake is one step from
 * repeatable: the H3 area table shifts by two resolutions between "cells per
 * chunk" (49) and "area per cell", and 49 is also the ratio being looked for.
 *
 * ## What is NOT settled
 *
 * `ensureScored` takes an arbitrary cell set and hands all of it to one
 * `planBatch`, so its selection box grows with the batch's SPREAD while the
 * useful output grows with its chunk COUNT. The geo-event reach is seeded
 * across an event tile and its admitted neighbours, so that box can be
 * kilometres rather than metres, and the ~1.8× above is a property of the disc
 * rather than of the batching. Not measured here — it needs a fixture holding
 * several adjacent fetch tiles, because `ensureScored` refuses any chunk whose
 * fetch tile is not held and a single-tile fixture therefore scores nothing.
 * See the follow-up doc.
