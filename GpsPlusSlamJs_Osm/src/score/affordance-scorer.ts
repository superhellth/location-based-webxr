/**
 * The multiplicative scoring kernel, ported from
 * `OsmHeatMapsManager.CalcHeatFor`.
 *
 * The whole engine is ~20 lines of arithmetic, and that is the point: the
 * valuable part of the C# system is not the code but the **tuned values** and
 * the fact that its tests pin exact expected products (a beach cell at
 * 5 × 7 = 35, a tile at 105). That makes this port *verifiable* rather than
 * merely plausible, which is why the model was kept over a bounded [0,1]
 * redesign.
 *
 * The engine is **category-agnostic**: it multiplies whatever numbers the rule
 * table declares under whatever category names the table declares. The game
 * vocabulary is just one possible table.

 * THE POINT OF THIS FUNCTION. `scoreFeature(feature, category, table)` reads the
 * feature's tags and the table — never the cell. So the factor is identical for
 * every cell the feature touches, and computing it inside the cell loop is work
 * whose result cannot differ, growing with the feature's area. On the
 * `building-block` fixture that was ~19,400 `scoreFeature` calls, each
 * allocating an `Object.entries(tags)` array, where 227 features × 6 categories
 * = 1,362 give byte-identical results.
 *
 * The C# reference makes the same mistake (`for element { for ruleName }`, per
 * tile) and is no better here. The difference is that this code runs inside an
 * AR frame budget, and the plan's own measurement already puts a dense chunk at
 * ~87 % of its 10 ms budget on a desktop.
 *
 * Pinned by "looks up each (feature, category) exactly once, however many cells
 * it spans" — a lookup COUNT, not a wall clock, because this repo has already
 * learned that a timing assertion inside a parallel suite measures the machine.
