/**
 * Scoring-kernel tests — the oracle tests, and the point of the whole iteration.
 *
 * Why these tests matter:
 * The C# reference's tests pin EXACT expected products: a beach cell at
 * 5 × 7 = 35, the same cell with a historic way at 105, a hard veto at 0. Those
 * numbers are the entire reason the multiplicative model was kept over a bounded
 * [0,1] redesign — they make this port *verifiable* rather than merely
 * plausible. If these pass, the port is faithful; if they drift, something in
 * the chain from CSV to cell is wrong and the rest of the package is scoring
 * confidently against nothing.
 *
 * Everything here uses a hand-built table with known inputs. That is deliberate:
 * an oracle needs exact known inputs, not whatever a real tile happens to
 * contain — which is also why the `beach` fixture (one element, the entire North
 * Sea) is NOT the right place for these.

   * the same for every cell it touches, and computing it once per (cell,
   * category, feature) is redundant work that grows with the feature's area.
   *
   * Measured on the `building-block` fixture before this was fixed: ~19,400
   * `scoreFeature` calls, each allocating an `Object.entries(tags)` array,
   * where 227 features × 6 categories = 1,362 give byte-identical results.
   * The C# reference has the same shape and is no better — but only this one
   * runs inside a 16 ms AR frame budget, and the plan's own measurement puts a
   * dense chunk at ~87 % of its 10 ms indexing budget on a DESKTOP.
   *
   * Asserting the count rather than the wall clock is deliberate: this repo has
   * already learned that a timing assertion inside a parallel suite measures
   * the machine, not the code (a "generous" 100 ms ceiling failed at 104 ms in
   * a contended run). A lookup count is machine-independent and says exactly
