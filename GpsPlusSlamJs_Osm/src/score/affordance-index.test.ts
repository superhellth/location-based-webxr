/**
 * Lifecycle tests for `AffordanceIndex`.
 *
 * WHY THESE TESTS MATTER. Everything below this class is a pure function, and
 * pure functions are trivially correct and expensive to run continuously. This
 * class exists to make a walking user cheap, and every claim in that sentence
 * is a behaviour that can silently stop being true without any pure-function
 * test noticing:
 *
 * - a move that does not leave the current res-11 chunk must do NO work;
 * - a move to an adjacent chunk must reuse the 12 chunks that overlap;
 * - a tile arriving late must invalidate exactly the chunks it can affect,
 *   notify, and force a recompute even though the user has not moved;
 * - geometry must be converted once per feature ever, not once per chunk;
 * - published results must not be mutable behind a consumer's back.
 *
 * Every assertion here is a COUNT or an identity, never a wall clock — a timing
 * assertion inside a parallel suite measures the machine, which this repo has
 * already learned the expensive way.
