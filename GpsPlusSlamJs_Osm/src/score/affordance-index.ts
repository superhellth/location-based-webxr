/**
 * The stateful owner of everything derived: geometry, per-chunk scores, and the
 * invalidation that keeps them honest when a tile arrives late.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Every module below this one is a pure function, which was
 * the right thing to build first and is the wrong thing to run continuously.
 * A walking user crosses a res-11 chunk every ~50 m; the new working set
 * overlaps the previous one by 12 of its 19 chunks; and rebuilding all of it
 * costs ~165 ms of measured main-thread work per step. The C# reference does
 * not do that — it converts each element's geometry **once per session**, scores
 * each tile **once and never again** (`OsmHeatMapsManager.loadedAreas`), and
 * makes the whole pipeline a no-op unless the user crosses a tile boundary
 * (`oldUserTile`). This class is that lifecycle, on the H3 ladder.
 *
 * What it owns, and why each one is here rather than recomputed:
 *
 * - **Merged features**, from `mergeTiles`. Tiles arrive over time and overlap;
 *   the merge is the only place that decides which copy of an element wins.
 * - **Geometry and its bbox, per feature, computed once ever.** Geometry
 *   conversion is the expensive half of indexing and its result never changes,
 *   so it survives every move. This is `OsmGeoSpatialIndexer`'s
 *   `geometryLookup`/`envelopeLookup` pair, which is the reference's single
 *   best performance idea.
 * - **Scored chunks**, keyed by res-11 cell. The plan already names the res-11
 *   chunk as "the unit of scoring, of caching of computed scores, and of cache
 *   eviction" (§4.4) and nothing had ever written one.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT OWN. Fetching. `acceptTile` is push-only: the
 * caller decides when to hit the network, and this class only reacts. That
 * keeps the network policy (slot budget, backoff, queueing) in `source/` where
 * it is tested against an injected `fetch`, and keeps this class synchronous
 * and worker-safe.

   * **84 % of `update`'s time was `polygonToCellsExperimental`** — the h3 call
   * behind `coverCells`. Not the bbox funnel, not clipping, not scoring. The
   * reason it dominated was repetition: a cold working set is 19 chunks, and a
   * feature touching several of them was clipped and covered once per chunk.
   *
   * The waste compounds with `CHUNK_MARGIN_DEG`. That margin is ~55 m against a
   * res-11 chunk's ~29 m edge, so each per-chunk selection box was ~135 m
   * across — nearly the size of the whole 19-chunk working set. Nineteen
   * overlapping ~135 m covers were being computed to fill a ~150 m area, and
   * all but the 49 cells belonging to the chunk being scored were discarded.
   * Covering the union once and bucketing the results by chunk does the same
   * work once, and the margin is now paid once rather than nineteen times.
   *
   * SOUNDNESS. A chunk's result must be a function of the chunk alone, or
   * scores would depend on the route the user walked. Two things secure that:
   * each chunk gets its own `byCell`/`kept`, and a coverage cell is attributed
   * via `cellToChunk`, which is a partition — `childCells` of distinct res-11
   * chunks are disjoint, so no cell can land in two buckets. Clipping to the
   * union rather than to one chunk cannot change a cell's coverage either:
   * clipping is an intersection, so for any cell inside the clip rectangle the
   * covered area is identical, and the union rectangle contains every
   * per-chunk one. `affordance-index.test.ts` pins this by scoring the same
   * chunks in differently-composed batches and comparing.
   *
   * The TWO-STAGE FUNNEL is unchanged, exactly as the reference queries its
   * quadtree: a cheap bbox test over EVERY feature, then the expensive work
   * only for survivors. The bbox comes from the raw inline positions, so a
   * feature the user will never walk near is never ring-stitched, never
   * classified area-vs-line and never converted at all. That matters at res 7:
   * a fetch tile holds ~21,800 features and a working set needs a handful.
