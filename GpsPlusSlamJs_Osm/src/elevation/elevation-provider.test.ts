/**
 * The elevation seam: the null provider, the median, and multi-source consensus.
 *
 * WHY CONSENSUS IS TESTED AT ALL. It is the one idea taken wholesale from the
 * C# reference's elevation lookup, which appends every sample from every
 * provider to a per-cell list and reads back the median. The reasoning survives
 * the port: a single DEM source serving wrong data for a region is undetectable
 * from inside, and two disagreeing sources are a signal available no other way.
 *
 * The tests therefore pin the two properties that make it worth the extra
 * request: a median (not a mean, because DEM disagreement is a large systematic
 * offset rather than noise), and a failing provider that costs nothing.
