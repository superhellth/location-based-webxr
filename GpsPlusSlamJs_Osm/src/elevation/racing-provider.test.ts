/**
 * `racingProvider` — both DEM sources at once, the faster one published, the
 * better one swapped in when it lands.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY THESE TESTS MATTER. Measured 2026-08-19 from one
 * machine: Mapterhorn (LiDAR-derived, the source worth having) returned four
 * z13 tiles in 3.0–21.7 s while AWS Open Data returned the same four in ~1.0 s,
 * with the CDN reporting a cache hit. Under `fallbackProvider` that produced a
 * 15 s stall and no elevation at all, because the fallback is consulted only
 * for positions the primary returned `undefined` for — a SLOW primary leaves no
 * gap, so the fallback was unreachable rather than broken.
 *
 * The deadline shipped in round one fixed the stall by cutting the primary off
 * at 3 s. On that connection every Mapterhorn tile exceeds 3 s, so the fix
 * traded the good heights away permanently. This is the composition that
 * removes the trade instead of moving it: publish whatever arrives first, and
 * upgrade in place when the better source lands.
 *
 * The failure mode being guarded is silence. An upgrade that never fires, or
 * fires with nothing, looks exactly like a working race — the map still shows
 * terrain, just always the coarse kind. Several tests below therefore assert
 * the UPGRADE, not merely that the first answer arrived.
