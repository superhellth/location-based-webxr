# `elevation/geoid.ts`

## Purpose

Orthometric to ellipsoidal height conversion — and the seam for the geoid
undulation model that makes it possible.

## Public API

- `interface GeoidModel` — `id`, `undulationMetres(position)`
- `ZERO_GEOID` — the identity, and the default
- `constantGeoid(n): GeoidModel`
- `gridGeoid(grid: UndulationGrid): GeoidModel`
- `toEllipsoidal(orthometric, position, geoid)`,
  `toOrthometric(ellipsoidal, position, geoid)`
- `describeGeoid(geoid): string`

## Invariants & assumptions

- **`ellipsoidal = orthometric + N`.** DEMs are orthometric; GNSS and the AR
  session are ellipsoidal. `N` is ~+45 m in central Europe and reaches ±100 m
  globally. Getting the sign backwards is a ~90 m error that looks like a fusion
  bug, not like a bug here — which is why it is in `lessons-learned.md`.
- **A verified EGM96 grid now ships — as an opt-in import, not in this file.**
  See [`egm96.ts.md`](./egm96.ts.md): `egm96Geoid()` from
  `gps-plus-slam-osm/elevation/egm96`, ~170 KB, measured at mean 0.25 m /
  max 5.0 m against exact evaluations.
  - **The original objection was never "a grid is a bad idea"** — it was "we must
    not ship numbers we cannot verify", because a plausible wrong geoid is a
    smooth confident tens-of-metres offset that looks like a fusion bug. That is
    answered by generating the grid from the reference EGM96 evaluator already
    in this project and pinning it against exact evaluations, rather than by
    waiving the concern.
  - It stays out of `elevation/index.ts` so an app that does not need absolute
    heights never pays for the bytes.
- **`ZERO_GEOID` is the default and is wrong everywhere on Earth.** It is chosen
  only because a library must not silently apply an unverifiable correction.
  `describeGeoid` exists so an app can SHOW which model is active — the
  dangerous state (`ZERO_GEOID` in a build rendering absolute heights) is
  otherwise invisible.
- **`constantGeoid` is the right answer for most apps here.** `N` varies ~1 m per
  100 km in mid-latitudes, so one value is accurate to centimetres across a city
  — two orders of magnitude below the DEM's own ~30 m posting.
- **`gridGeoid` validates shape at construction**, because a values/rows x cols
  mismatch would read zeros off the end and produce a smoothly wrong field.
- **Latitude clamps; longitude wraps ONLY for a global grid** — one where
  `cols × stepDeg === 360`, decided once at construction rather than per lookup.
  - `egm96Geoid()` is such a grid (360 cols × 1°), so it stays correct across
    the antimeridian.
  - A **regional** grid clamps to its edge value instead. Wrapping one
    unconditionally is worse than returning NaN: a query outside its span reads
    an interior column, so `gridGeoid({ westLng: 5, stepDeg: 1, cols: 10, … })`
    asked for 25°E used to answer with the grid's _middle_ — smooth, plausible,
    confidently wrong, and indistinguishable from a fusion bug.

## Examples

```ts
// Look N up once for your area (NGA's EGM96 calculator, or the C#
// GeoidHeights.undulation) and pass it.
const geoid = constantGeoid(47); // central Germany
const ellipsoidal = toEllipsoidal(demHeight, position, geoid);
console.log(describeGeoid(geoid));
```

## Tests

`geoid.test.ts` — conversion direction and round trip, the default applying no
correction and saying so, `constantGeoid` validation, and `gridGeoid`'s corner
values, bilinear interior, shape rejection, degenerate rejection and clamp/wrap
behaviour. There is deliberately no "N at Cologne is 47 m" test: the package
ships no undulation data, so such a test would only assert a number the test
itself supplied.
