/**
 * Terrarium terrain tiles — decoding, tile arithmetic, and the provider.
 *
 * WHY RASTER TILES AT ALL. The C# reference looked elevation up **per point**
 * against point-query APIs, five points per heat tile. That does not survive
 * the move to res 13: the public OpenTopoData endpoint allows 100 locations per
 * request, 1 request/second and 1,000 requests/day, while a single res-7 fetch
 * tile holds ~117,649 res-13 cells — roughly six times the entire daily global
 * quota, for one tile. A raster tile is decoded ONCE and then sampled for any
 * number of points at zero marginal cost, which is the only thing that makes
 * elevation at this resolution possible at all.
 *
 * WHY THE PNG DECODER IS INJECTED. This package has one peer dependency and no
 * runtime dependencies, and it must run in a Web Worker, on the main thread and
 * in Node. There is no PNG decoder common to all three: the browser has
 * `createImageBitmap` + `OffscreenCanvas`, Node has none without a dependency.
 * So the decoder is a parameter. `browserPngDecoder()` supplies the browser
 * one; tests supply a synthetic one and never touch an image codec at all,
 * which is also what makes the decode maths testable byte-exactly.
 *
