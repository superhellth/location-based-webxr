/**
 * `racingProvider` over arbitrary answers, failures and arrival orders.
 *
 * WHY A PROPERTY SPEC AND NOT MORE EXAMPLES. This composition's contract is
 * three universally quantified statements — the published heights are one
 * source's answer and never a blend of both, the output length always matches
 * the input, and no combination of empty answers or failures makes it throw for
 * missing data — over inputs that are trivially generatable. The example tests
 * next door pin hand-picked pairs at hand-picked arrival orders, which is
 * exactly the shape that leaves "both empty", "one empty and the other failed"
 * and "the loser lands first" unexercised.
 *
 * The blend property is the one worth the file on its own. `consensusProvider`
 * exists next door and medians its inputs; a future refactor that reaches for it
 * here would average a LiDAR height with a coarse global one and throw the
 * resolution advantage away — smoothly, plausibly, and with every example test
 * still green because the average of two similar heights looks like a height.
