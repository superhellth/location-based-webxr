/**
 * Terrarium decoding, tile arithmetic and the provider.
 *
 * WHY THESE TESTS MATTER. Elevation's failure mode is not a crash — it is a
 * plausible number. A sign error in the +32,768 offset, a swapped x/y in the
 * Mercator maths, or a nearest-neighbour read where bilinear was intended all
 * produce terrain that looks like terrain and is wrong. So every test here
 * pins an EXACT value derived from the published encoding, not a tolerance.
 *
 * No image codec is involved: the decoder is injected, so these tests construct
 * RGBA bytes directly and the decode maths is checked byte-exactly. That is the
 * main reason the decoder is a parameter rather than a browser API call.

   * colour-manage on the way through: a `gAMA`, `sRGB` or `iCCP` chunk in the
   * PNG lets the user agent rewrite the triple, and alpha premultiplication can
   * rewrite it again. Both default to "the UA may".
   *
   * A one-step shift in R is **256 metres** of elevation, delivered as a smooth
   * plausible surface — precisely the "looks like a fusion bug" failure this
   * module is organised around, and the reason the opt-outs are not optional.
   *
   * The corruption itself cannot be reproduced here: it needs a real codec and a
   * real colour-managed compositor, and every other test in this file injects a
   * synthetic decoder specifically to avoid one. So what is pinned instead is
   * that the decoder ASKS for the opt-outs — which is the part a future edit
   * could silently drop, with no visible symptom until someone compares a
   * rendered city against a survey.
