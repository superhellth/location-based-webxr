/**
 * The elevation seam.
 *
 * WHY A SEAM RATHER THAN A FUNCTION. The plan's §7 recommends Terrarium raster
 * tiles and that recommendation is the least externally-validated part of the
 * whole plan — it is explicitly gated on a DEM survey that has not landed. So
 * the one thing that must be right today is the shape of the boundary, because
 * everything downstream (region elevation, the AR bridge) is written against it
 * and the provider behind it is expected to change.
 *
 * THE CONTRACT, and each clause is load-bearing:
 *
 * - **Batch in, batch out.** `elevationAt` takes many positions and returns one
 *   answer per position, in order. A per-point API would make the raster
 *   provider's whole advantage inexpressible and would invite the C# reference's
 *   original mistake of five point queries per tile.
 * - **`undefined` means "no data here", never `0`.** Zero is a real elevation
 *   (most of the Netherlands is near it) and a provider that returns it on
 *   failure produces a plausible wrong answer. The C# reference's own
 *   `NoElevationLookup` returns `1` rather than `0` for exactly this reason —
 *   it had an assertion that rejected zero, which is a workaround for a type
 *   that could not say "I don't know".
 * - **Orthometric metres, above the geoid.** DEMs are orthometric; GNSS and the
 *   AR session are ellipsoidal. The conversion is `geoid.ts`'s job and is NOT
 *   applied here, so a caller always knows which datum it holds. Getting this
 *   wrong produces a consistent tens-of-metres vertical offset that is easy to
 *   mistake for a fusion bug.
 * - **A provider never throws for missing data.** Network and decode failures
 *   degrade to `undefined` per point; only programmer errors throw.

 * design worth keeping wholesale: a single DEM source serving wrong data for a
 * region is undetectable, and two disagreeing sources are a signal you cannot
 * get any other way.
 *
 * Median rather than mean because DEM disagreement is not Gaussian — one source
 * being wrong about a region is a large systematic offset, exactly the case a
 * mean is worst at and a median shrugs off.
 *
 * Providers are queried in parallel; one that rejects contributes nothing

 * both sources answer, a high-resolution primary (say, national LiDAR) is
 * blended with a coarse global fallback and its resolution advantage is simply
 * thrown away — the worst of both, delivered smoothly. Consensus is the right
 * tool when the sources are peers and disagreement is the signal; when one
 * source is strictly better wherever it has data, the right composition is
 * explicit precedence: the primary's answers survive untouched, the fallback
 * is consulted ONLY for positions the primary returned `undefined`, and every
 * seam in the output is attributable to a known coverage boundary rather than
 * to an anonymous blend.
 *
 * The retry is batched — one fallback call carrying just the missing
 * positions, results merged back at their original indices — so the fallback's
 * quota is spent only on true gaps. A fallback failure degrades those gaps to
 * `undefined` and never destroys the primary's answers; an abort from either
