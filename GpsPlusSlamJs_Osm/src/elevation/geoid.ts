/**
 * Orthometric ↔ ellipsoidal height conversion.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS THE MOST DANGEROUS FILE IN THE PACKAGE.
 *
 * DEMs report **orthometric** height — above the geoid, i.e. mean sea level.
 * GNSS and the AR session work in **ellipsoidal** height, above the WGS84
 * ellipsoid. The two differ by the geoid undulation `N`:
 *
 *     ellipsoidal = orthometric + N
 *
 * `N` reaches ±100 m globally and is around **+45 m in central Europe**. Get it
 * wrong and every elevation is consistently tens of metres out — which does not
 * look like a bug in this file. It looks like a bug in the GPS+SLAM fusion,
 * which is a much more expensive place to go looking. That is why this is in
 * `lessons-learned.md` on day one rather than after someone loses a week.
 *
 * WHAT IS AND IS NOT SHIPPED HERE, and the reasoning is deliberately explicit
 * because the omission is the interesting part:
 *
 * The C# reference computes `N` properly, by evaluating the EGM96 spherical
 * harmonic series to degree 360 — which needs a **5 MB coefficient table**
 * (`Algorithms/AltitudeCalculation/Coef.cs`). That is a completely reasonable
 * thing to do in a desktop/Unity build and a completely unreasonable thing to
 * ship in a browser package whose entire dependency budget is one peer.
 *
 * **A verified 1-degree grid now ships as an opt-in import** — see
 * `egm96.ts`, and note what changed: the original objection was never "a grid
 * is a bad idea", it was "we must not ship numbers we cannot verify", because a
 * plausible wrong geoid is a confident, smooth, entirely wrong vertical offset
 * that no test would catch and that presents as a fusion bug. That is answered
 * by generating the grid with the reference evaluator and pinning it against
 * exact evaluations — not by waiving the concern. It lives behind its own entry
 * point (~170 KB) so an app that does not need absolute heights never pays.
 *
 * The model is still **injected**, and four are provided —
 *
 * - `egm96Geoid()` from `./egm96.js` — correct anywhere on Earth, mean 0.25 m.
 *
 * - `constantGeoid(n)` — the practical answer for an app operating in one
 *   region. Look `N` up once for your area (NGA's EGM96 calculator, or the C#
 *   `GeoidHeights.undulation`) and pass it. Wrong by centimetres over a city,
 *   which is far below the DEM's own ~30 m posting.
 * - `gridGeoid(grid)` — bilinear interpolation over a supplied undulation grid,
 *   for an app that has one.
 * - `ZERO_GEOID` — the identity, and the default, because a library must not
 *   silently apply a made-up correction. It is documented as introducing a
 *   systematic offset, and `describeGeoid` exists so an app can SHOW which
 *   model is in use rather than discovering it in the field.
 *
 * @see geoid.ts.md
