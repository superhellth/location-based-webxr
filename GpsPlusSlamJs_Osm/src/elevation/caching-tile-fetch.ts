/**
 * A `fetch`-compatible wrapper that persists GET-tile bytes in a blob store.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `TerrariumProvider`'s only cache is a small in-memory Map of
 * decoded tiles, so an offline cold start has no terrain at all — and the AR
 * failure mode is not an error but a silently wrong flat datum. Composed into
 * the provider's `fetchImpl` seam, this wrapper makes every successfully
 * fetched tile survive a restart:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const provider = new TerrariumProvider({
 *   decodePng: browserPngDecoder(),
 *   fetchImpl: createCachingTileFetch({ store }),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * WHY A FETCH WRAPPER RATHER THAN A PROVIDER DECORATOR. The provider already
 * exposes `fetchImpl?: typeof fetch` as an injection seam, so caching at that
 * seam needs no new provider API, works for any URL template (AWS Terrarium,
 * Mapterhorn, a self-hosted mirror), and stores the ENCODED tile — a PNG/WebP
 * is a fraction of the decoded `Float32Array`'s size, and decode-on-hit is the
 * provider's existing job.
 *
 * CACHE INVALIDATION IS DELIBERATELY NONE (v1) — AND THAT MEANS UNBOUNDED.
 * Terrain tiles are effectively static — the underlying DEMs change on a
 * timescale of years, and a stale hill is still the hill — so this wrapper
 * never expires, revalidates, or evicts. Nothing else bounds it either: the
 * `OsmBlobStore` seam exposes `delete`/`keys` but carries no eviction policy
 * of its own, and no current consumer ever deletes DEM entries. Growth is one
 * encoded tile per distinct URL ever fetched; an explicit eviction pass is a
 * known follow-up, not a property to assume.
 *
 * Runs wherever `Response` and the injected store run — window, Worker, Node.
 * Nothing here touches `window`; persistence portability is the store's
 * business (see `../source/osm-blob-store.ts`).
 *
 * @see caching-tile-fetch.ts.md

 * - **Miss** — delegates to `fetchImpl`. A 200 is persisted from a clone, so

 *   errors pass through untouched and store nothing (caching a transient 404
 *   in a store that never invalidates would poison the URL forever).
