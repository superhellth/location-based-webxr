 *  - **Per-segment reversal.** The reference reverses its accumulated result

 * every call, and `growChain` calls this on BOTH chain ends every iteration,
 * including the end that loses. A high-degree node (a branching fan, which the
 * differential generator produces) leaves a large live bucket that never wins
