/**
 * OSM element → geometry conversion.
 *
 * The rules here are ported from the C# reference's `OsmExtensions`, with one
 * deliberate upgrade: area detection uses osmtogeojson's `polygonFeatures`
 * table (vendored as `polygon-features.ts`) instead of the reference's
 * `highway`-only rule, which mis-classifies closed `barrier=fence` and
 * `natural=coastline`. The table still yields the reference's answer for the
 * case its oracle pins (closed `highway=footway` → LineString), so adopting it
 * is strictly a widening.
 *
 * Every entry point returns a result object rather than throwing. A single bad
 * element must degrade to "skipped and counted", never to a failed tile.
