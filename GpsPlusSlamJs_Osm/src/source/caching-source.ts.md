# `source/caching-source.ts`

## Purpose

Cache-first decorator around any `OsmDataSource`, backed by an injected
`OsmBlobStore`.

## Public API

- `CachingSource` implementing `OsmDataSource`.
- `cacheKey(tile)` → `osm/v{schemaVersion}/{tile}`.
- `ensureTile(tile, { signal?, maxAgeMs? })`.
- `listCachedTiles()` → `FETCH_RES` (res-7) cell ids.
- `evictTile(tile)`.
- `stats` — `{ hits, misses, staleRefetches, deduplicated, staleOnRateLimit }`.

## Invariants & assumptions

- **Keyed by the fixed H3 grid cell, never by the query bbox.** This is the
  single most consequential decision in the package's caching: a walking user
  generates a slightly different bbox every second, so a bbox-keyed cache hits
  zero percent of the time _while looking entirely healthy_ — unbounded network
  cost with no error to notice. A test drives 25 requests through one tile and
  asserts exactly one downstream call.
- **The schema version is in the key AND checked in the payload.** Belt and
  braces: a store shared between package versions could return a v1 blob under a
  v2 key after a manual migration.
- **Cache-first, stale-is-fine, but expiry is the consumer's policy.** The
  library never expires anything on its own. `maxAgeMs` is per call, because
  "indefinitely" is too strong for a UI — an AR overlay showing a building
  demolished two years ago is a bug, not acceptable staleness.
- **`fetchedAt` is preserved through the cache**, so provenance describes when
  the data was retrieved rather than when it was last read.
- **A refused slot is answered from the stale copy, not propagated** — counted
  as `staleOnRateLimit`. This is the one failure where the cache holds the
  better answer: nothing is wrong upstream and the data returns shortly, so
  rethrowing would make `loadTiles` file the tile as `deferred` and the caller
  render nothing while a usable copy sits in the store.
  - Narrow on both axes, and each half has its own test. Any error that is not
    a `RateLimitedError` still propagates, because a broken source must not
    hide behind a stale render. A rate limit with an EMPTY cache still rejects,
    because "not fetched yet" is a real answer a caller must be able to tell
    apart from "no data here".
- **A corrupt entry is a miss, never a throw.** Truncated writes, quota eviction
  mid-write and lying backends all happen. The cost of being wrong is one
  refetch; the cost of throwing is a permanently poisoned tile.
- **A throwing store is also a miss** — quota-exceeded and permission-revoked
  both throw on read.
- **Concurrent misses for one tile make one downstream call.** The inner
  source's own dedup only helps if the inner source has one; a `FixtureSource`
  or a future PMTiles source may not.
  - Via [`InFlightRequests`](./in-flight-requests.ts.md), so joined callers do
    not share an `AbortSignal`. The inner source therefore receives an internal
    signal rather than the caller's — the tests assert cancellation still
    reaches it, and that one caller's abort leaves the other's tile alone.
- **Eviction is never automatic.** Only the host app knows its storage budget
  and which areas the user cares about, so the library exposes
  `listCachedTiles`/`evictTile` and nothing more.

## Tests

`caching-source.test.ts` — the cache key (including the 25-request walking-user
regression and both schema-version guards), cache-first behaviour, staleness
policy, the rate-limit fallback and its two negative cases, five corrupt-entry
shapes plus a throwing store, eviction, and decorator transparency.

## `timings` — and the two rules a reader would not guess

This decorator fills `OsmTileTimings` (see `osm-data-source.ts.md`) on every
path, and two of its behaviours are invariants rather than details:

- **Timings are STRIPPED before `store.put`.** The write serialises the whole
  result, so a `timings` left on it would be persisted into OPFS and replayed on
  every later hit — the warm path would report the originating network's
  `transportMs` forever, and parse (the term the click-path plan is hunting)
  would be measured on the wrong path entirely. This is the single most
  consequential line in the file and it is one keystroke from being wrong with
  no error to notice; `tile-timings.test.ts` asserts the stored blob has no
  `timings` key.
- **The joiner copy lives HERE, not only in the inner source.** This class runs
  its own `InFlightRequests` and dedups FIRST, so in the demo's wiring the inner
  Overpass client sees exactly one caller and its joiner branch never runs. The
  first implementation put the copy only there, which made it dead code in
  production: two colliding refresh passes were both told the click cost a full
  network fetch.

Per path:

- **Hit** — `servedBy: "cache"`; the OPFS read is `transportMs`, the blob's
  `JSON.parse` is `decodeMs`, and `parseMs` is **genuinely 0** because
  `parseOverpassJson` never runs.
- **Miss / stale** — the inner source's timings, plus `storeMs` for the awaited
  write and `probeMs` for the cache read that did not serve the answer. On a
  large blob a stale probe is the second-largest term on that path; unattributed
  it would surface in the residual looking like an unenumerated stage.
- **Joined** — `joinedMs` **plus `probeMs`**. The joiner runs a full
  `readCachedTimed` before it discovers there is a request to join, and the join
  clock starts after that, so the probe needs carrying explicitly or it belongs
  to no stage. It was dropped until 2026-08-12 (r504 review), which showed up
  downstream as click-level residual rather than as a lost measurement.
- **Stale-on-rate-limit** — its own `servedBy`, with `probeMs` carrying the real
  cost. The zeros beside it are true (no request went out), which is only
  readable because `servedBy` says which path produced them.
