/**
 * Query-construction and bbox tests.
 *
 * Why these tests matter:
 * The bbox is derived from the H3 cell, and it is LARGER than the hexagon. That
 * is deliberate and harmless (dedup happens by element id at index time) but it
 * makes "features in a tile" and "features returned for a tile" different sets
 * — which is exactly the sort of thing that gets forgotten and then misread as
 * a coverage bug. The overlap property below states it as an assertion.
