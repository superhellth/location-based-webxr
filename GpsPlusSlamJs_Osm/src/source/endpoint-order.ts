/**
 * The order one tile's attempts visit the endpoint pool.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT `attempt % endpoints.length`. The pool has been
 * through three designs, and each fixed the previous one's real defect while
 * introducing its own:
 *
 * 1. **Random start** (until 2026-07-28) — spread load, but made the pool order
 *    decorative: every client drew uniformly, so the slowest instance served its
 *    full share. Measured 4.2x slower than the fastest host on identical work.
 * 2. **Strict preference order** (2026-07-28 → 2026-08-19) — the fastest host
 *    always first, and the cost was named at the time: "the cost is herding:
 *    every client now tries `endpoints[0]` first". The twelfth testing session
 *    is that cost arriving — a 429 on entry 0, every time.
 * 3. **This.** Weighted draw, so the measured-best host is most likely but not
 *    certain, and the herd spreads without the pool order becoming decorative.
 *
 * **AND ONE FACT NEITHER OF THE FIRST TWO KNEW.** Five entries are three
 * operators (`overpass-operators.ts`), so a draw over ENTRIES gives FOSSGIS
 * three tickets in every raffle and makes a 429 on one of them predict a 429 on
 * the next. This draws over OPERATORS first and picks an entry within the
 * chosen operator second, which is why the sequence visits three distinct
 * quotas before it revisits any.
 *
 * @see endpoint-order.ts.md

/**
 * How likely an operator is to be drawn, relative to the others.
 *
 * A WEIGHT, NOT A RANK, and not a latency either. Latencies here do not
 * replicate — `spatial/resolutions.ts` records the same work at 15.1 / 32.9 /
 * 82.9 / 91.1 s — so a weight computed as `1 / median` would be a precise
 * function of noise. Coarse tiers are the honest shape: they say "prefer this
 * one" without claiming to know by how much.

 * The endpoints to try, in the order to try them.

 * `maxRetries` was smaller than the pool.
 *
 * Two rules, applied in this order:
 *
 * 1. **Distinct operators first, drawn by weight without replacement.** So the
 *    first three attempts against the default pool hit three different quotas.
 *    A refusal from one says nothing about the next, which is exactly the
 *    property the old modulo destroyed.
 * 2. **Within an operator, its entries in pool order.** They share a quota, so
 *    there is nothing to gain by randomising between them, and pool order is
 *    already the measured preference.
 *
 * `random` is injected and must return `[0, 1)`. Tests pass a scripted sequence;
 * production passes `Math.random`.
