 * Three concurrent queries returned `200, 429, 200` while a status read 600 ms
 * into the burst still reported the full allocation free. Asking the server
 * "may I?" before each request therefore does not prevent 429s.
 *
 * So slots are counted here, decremented the instant a request is dispatched,

 * times — never as a pre-flight gate.

   * permanently false and take `capacity`, the "a real 429 outranks a claim of
   * no limit" rule and their tests down with it, which is a much larger
   * deletion of live defensive behaviour than the decision contemplated.
   *

   * comparison below); it is no longer a trap for the next caller.
