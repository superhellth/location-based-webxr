/**
 * Overpass network-discipline tests.
 *
 * Why these tests matter:
 * The plan calls §5.3 "non-negotiable, and each item gets a test", and the
 * reason is not tidiness. The public Overpass servers are donated
 * infrastructure with roughly 1,000,000 requests/day of capacity shared by
 * every OSM application worldwide; the informal safe budget is <10,000
 * queries/day per consumer. A missing dedup or a retry storm in a library that
 * ships to phones is not a performance bug, it is an abuse of a shared resource
 * that gets everyone blocked.
 *
 * Every dependency is injected (fetch, clock, sleeper, RNG) so this file runs
 * offline, deterministically, in milliseconds, and never hits a real server.
 *
