/**
 * The key-count curve's shape must still be in the artefact the doc quotes.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The 2026-08-19 one-key probe revived the cold-start prefetch
 * by showing that Overpass latency is driven by the number of key statements
 * rather than by area. This sweep put a curve through that with six points, and
 * the curve is what a build/do-not-build decision rests on: eight keys costs
 * ~15 s against the full query's ~22 s, so a "half now, half later" split is not
 * worth building and only a very small first request is.
 *
 * This repo has formally retracted three latency figures that outlived the run
 * that produced them. So the claim the decision rests on is asserted against the
 * committed artefact rather than trusted to a document nobody re-runs.
 *
 * IT NEVER TOUCHES THE NETWORK (DEC-T10): measurement I/O lives in the `.mjs`
 * scripts, this reads a file, and it sits beside the artefact inside a gate that
 * actually runs it.
