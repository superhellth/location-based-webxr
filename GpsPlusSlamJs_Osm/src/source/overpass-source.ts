/**
 * Default endpoint pool.
 *
 * **THE ORDER IS NO LONGER THE SELECTION RULE (M6, 2026-08-19).** It used to be:
 * `pickEndpoint` walked this list from the front and did not shuffle, so every
 * client tried entry 0 first — the herding that decision knowingly accepted, and
 * the 429 the twelfth testing session reported. Selection now happens in
 * `endpoint-order.ts`, as a weighted draw over OPERATORS
 * ({@link DEFAULT_OPERATOR_WEIGHTS}), and this list contributes two things to
 * it: which endpoints exist, and the order of an operator's own entries.
 *
 * The measurement below is kept because it is still the evidence for the
 * weights, and because the two facts it establishes about the pool's SHAPE —
 * which entries are the same instance — do not expire the way the timings do.
 *
 * Ordered from a measurement, not a guess. All six known free global instances
 * were timed on one identical res-7 Cologne tile on 2026-07-28 21:43 UTC
 * (`scripts/benchmark-endpoints.mjs`; results in
 * `GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-07-28-2344-overpass-endpoint-benchmark-results.md`):
 *
 * - `lz4.overpass-api.de` — 200 OK, 27.6 s
 * - `maps.mail.ru` (VK Maps) — 200 OK, 22.9 s
 * - `z.overpass-api.de` — 200 OK, 36.1 s
 * - `overpass.private.coffee` — 200 OK, 110.4 s
 * - `overpass.kumi.systems` — 200 OK, 96.8 s
 * - `overpass-api.de` — **504 Gateway Timeout** after 8.3 s
 *
 * **`overpass.kumi.systems` and `overpass.private.coffee` are the same
 * instance** — byte-identical payloads (66,348,574 B), differing from every
 * other host's (67,973,393 B), confirming the OSM wiki's "Private.coffee
 * (formerly overpass.kumi.systems)". Only the canonical name is listed; keeping
 * both would inflate the apparent pool without adding an operator.
 *
 * **`z.` and `lz4.` are NOT independent quotas** — byte-identical to each other,
 * they are the backends `overpass-api.de` load-balances across. So this pool is
 * three operators, not four entries' worth of headroom, and **the real answer to
 * a quota problem is still a self-hosted instance passed in via `endpoints`.**
 *
 * The FOSSGIS **main** entry is last because it is the only host that failed the
 * query outright; a host that cannot serve it is worse than a slow one that can.
 * Its 8.3 s 504 matches the signature of the key-regex form
 * (`capture-script-query.test.ts`), suggesting a front-end timeout shorter than
 * this query needs rather than a data problem — which is why its own backends
 * answer fine. It stays in the pool: one failure is not grounds for removal.
 *
 * **This order has a shelf life.** It is one sample per host, from one location,
 * at one time of day. Re-run the script rather than trusting it indefinitely.

 * four of the five endpoints. With the old `attempt % length` selection that
 * meant bare `overpass-api.de` was never asked by any request, in the shipped
 * configuration, silently. `endpoint-order.ts` now returns a permutation and
 * this reaches all of it.
 *
 * **WHAT IT COSTS, stated properly — an earlier version of this comment claimed
 * it cost nothing and was wrong three times over.** It said every attempt is
 * gated by the slot budget (it is not: `tryAcquire` runs once per TILE, in
 * `fetchTileUncached`, and all five attempts ride that one slot), that the
 * fifth attempt needs "four operators-worth of hosts" to refuse (the default
 * pool has THREE operators), and that the change was free (it is not).
 *
 * For a tile where everything refuses, against the default pool:
 *
 * - **requests to FOSSGIS go from 2 to 3.** The draw spends attempts 0–2 on
 *   three distinct operators, so the added attempts are the remaining FOSSGIS
 *   entries — i.e. the extra request goes to a quota already known to have said
 *   no.
 * - **backoff sleeps go from 1 to 2**, because attempts 3 and 4 both follow a
 *   refused operator. With `Retry-After` that is up to +30 s of wall clock.
 *
 * That is the price of making a pool entry reachable at all, and it is paid
 * only on the fully-refusing path — a permanent failure still escapes the loop
 * immediately, and any success ends it. It is recorded here rather than
 * defended, because the results doc's own finding is that 504s are the normal
 * path (25 % of attempts), so this is not a corner case. **The follow-up worth
 * taking:** once every distinct operator has refused, the remaining entries are
 * near-certainly futile, and stopping there would recover both the request and
 * the sleep.
 *
 * **The number is coupled to the DEFAULT pool's size**, and it travels: a
 * caller passing a single self-hosted endpoint inherits five attempts and four
 * sleeps against one host. Override `maxRetries` alongside `endpoints`.

 * - **private.coffee** — res 7: 59.9 (n=3), res 8: 179.3 (n=1). Answered
 *   **4 of 7**.
 *
 * **What the data supports, stated no more strongly than that.**
 * `private.coffee` IS separated, on both axes at once: 57 % availability, and
 * medians 2.2x (res 7) to 8.3x (res 8) FOSSGIS's, including one 179 s success.
 * That demotion is evidence-backed.
 *
 * **The 4:3 between the two fast operators is NOT.** Their res-8 medians differ
 * by 0.2 s; the availability gap is 9/11 against 3/4, which one flipped result
 * would erase; and FOSSGIS has more samples only because the benchmark's host
 * list carries three FOSSGIS URLs to VK's one, which is a property of the
 * inventory rather than of the operator. An earlier version of this comment
 * offered those last two as grounds — a reviewer was right that they are noise
 * and circularity respectively. **4:3 is a near-tie broken arbitrarily**, and it
 * is written down as arbitrary so nobody later "preserves" a ranking that was
 * never measured. 1:1 would be equally defensible; what matters is that neither
 * is anywhere near `private.coffee`.
 *
 * A weight computed as `1 / median` would be a precise function of noise —
 * `spatial/resolutions.ts` records the same work at 15.1 / 32.9 / 82.9 / 91.1 s
 * — so these are tiers, and `operator-weights-evidence.test.ts` guards only
 * what the run can settle: that a materially more RELIABLE operator is never
 * weighted below a less reliable one.
 *
 * **These expire.** The strict order they replaced was one sample per host from
 * one location at one time of day, and it lasted three weeks before a field
 * session reported the herding it caused. Re-run
 * `node scripts/benchmark-endpoints.mjs --matrix --forms areal-only
 * --resolutions 8,7 --repeats 2 --out <dated>.json` and revise.

   * Whether to sleep before the next attempt — or rotate to a fresh operator

   *
   * THE DEFECT THIS REMOVES (twelfth testing session, F2c). The loop rotates
   * endpoints on every attempt AND slept the full backoff between them, so a
   * 429 from `lz4.overpass-api.de` made the client wait for **FOSSGIS's** quota
   * to recover — honouring `Retry-After`, clamped at 30 s — and then ask
   * `maps.mail.ru`, a different operator whose quota was never the problem. The
   * owner measured a 429 followed by "another 30 seconds" before anything
   * appeared. The sleep bought nothing for the host about to be asked.
   *
   * So the rule is: **sleep only when the next attempt would return to an
   * operator that has already refused.** Backoff is preserved exactly where it
   * is meaningful — pressure on a quota — and dropped where it was only
   * latency.
   *
   * With the default pool and the M6 draw, the first three attempts go to three
   * DIFFERENT operators, so none of them waits; the first wait is before the
   * **fourth** attempt, which is the first that must revisit a refused quota.
   * (This paragraph said "the attempt after that — `z.overpass-api.de`" until
   * the M6 draw landed and made it false: under the old fixed walk the third
   * attempt was `z.`, FOSSGIS again. The test in the same commit had the new
   * behaviour right while this comment still described the old one.)
   *
   * IT ALSO CATCHES A PURE-WASTE SLEEP NOBODY REPORTED: the retryable-status
   * path had no `attempt >= maxRetries` guard, so the LAST attempt slept up to
   * 30 s and then fell out of the loop and threw. Nothing could ever use that
