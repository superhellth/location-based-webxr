/**
 * Slot-budget tests.
 *
 * Why these tests matter:
 * This is the only component that decides whether a request is dispatched at
 * all, so every quota bug this package could ever have passes through here. It
 * exists as a separate thing from the `/api/status` parser because of a
 * measured fact: **`/api/status` lags actual consumption.** Three concurrent
 * queries returned `200, 429, 200` while a status read 600 ms into the burst
 * still reported the full allocation free. A client that asked the server
 * "may I?" before each request would therefore still get 429s.
 *
 * So the budget is authoritative and local: decremented the instant a request
 * is dispatched, restored when it completes, and re-synced from `/api/status`
 * only as a correction and a source of recovery times.
 *
 * Every test injects the clock — none of them sleep.
 *
