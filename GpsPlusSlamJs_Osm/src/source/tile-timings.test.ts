/**
 * `OsmTileResult.timings` — the fetch/parse split, and the traps in it.
 *
 * Why these tests matter: the click-path stage-timing plan predicts that PARSE,
 * not network, dominates a warm-cache click, and the only way to find out is to
 * time them apart. Every assertion here exists because getting one of these
 * wrong produces a breakdown that looks plausible and points at the wrong
 * stage — which is worse than no breakdown, because it gets acted on.
 *
 * The four traps, each pinned below:
 *
 *  1. **Persisted timings.** `CachingSource` serialises the whole result into
 *     OPFS. A `timings` left on it comes back on every later hit, so the warm
 *     path reports the original network fetch forever and parse — the term the
 *     plan is hunting — is measured on the wrong path.
 *  2. **`parseMs: 0` vs absent.** Zero is the true answer on a cache hit
 *     (`parseOverpassJson` does not run); absent means nobody measured. A
 *     consumer that cannot tell them apart cannot reconcile a breakdown.
 *  3. **Joiners.** `InFlightRequests` gives N callers one delivery. A caller
 *     that waited 200 ms on someone else's slow fetch did not spend that time.
 *  4. **Queueing before transport.** The concurrency limiter makes callers wait
 *     before any request is built. Folded into transport it reads as a slow
 *     server; dropped, it reads as time that never happened.
 *
 * Every clock here is injected and advances by a fixed step per read, so each
 * stage's duration is exactly attributable — a test that asserts "some number
 * appeared" would pass against an instrument that timed the wrong interval.
 *
