 *

 * tag of each one.** So the long tail the scoring model depends on survives: a
 * building matched on `building` still arrives carrying `wheelchair=yes`, a path
 * matched on `highway` still arrives carrying `surface=sand`. What is lost is
 * only elements carrying NONE of these keys.
 *
 * **Only ever widen this list.** Every key removed is scoring signal that can
 * never arrive, and the symptom is silent — an element that never arrives scores
 * the multiplicative identity, which reads as "nothing is mapped here" rather

 * - **One union block, one trailing `out`** — the union is a set, so each

 *   statements as separate queries.)
