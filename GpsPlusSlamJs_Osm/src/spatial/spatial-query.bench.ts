/**
 * The spatial index's two open numbers, measured together.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Every figure in the plan docs so far is about BUILDING an
 * index, while the requirement is *"queries answer in microseconds against the
 * resident structure"*. Query cost had never been measured at all, and the one
 * build number that was taken turned out to time geometry conversion rather than
 * the bbox pass it claimed. This is the harness for both, checked in — the last
 * one was thrown away, which is precisely why none of its conclusions were
 * falsifiable.
 *
 * WHAT `flatbush` IS DOING HERE. It is a **devDependency**, the pattern `earcut`
 * and `osmtogeojson` already establish in this package: a benchmark and an oracle
 * that never ships. It is measured rather than assumed because it is a packed
 * Hilbert R-tree whose entire index is one `ArrayBuffer` — which is exactly the
 * "flat typed arrays, transferable, implicit tree" the design settled on, so if
 * it fits there is nothing to hand-roll. Whether it ships is a separate decision,
 * taken after these numbers rather than before.
 *
 * THE THREE COSTS A FRAME QUERY PAYS, separated on purpose because they have
 * completely different shapes:
 *
 * 1. **Build** — once per resident-set change, not per frame.
 * 2. **Broad phase** — the tree's own bbox search. Should be microseconds.
 * 3. **Narrow phase** — `polygonsOverlap` per surviving candidate. This is the
 *    one nobody has priced, and it is where a 1 031-point ring would hurt.
 *
 * The measurement deliberately reports broad and narrow separately: a design that
 * passes on tree speed and fails on narrow-phase cost looks identical in a
 * combined number, and that is the distinction the whole funnel exists for.
 *
 * SCOPE, stated so the numbers are not over-read: the predicate answers for
 * POLYGONS only (see `ring-overlap.ts.md`), so this prices the areal features and
 * says nothing about points and lines — two thirds of the corpus — whose contract
 * does not exist yet.
