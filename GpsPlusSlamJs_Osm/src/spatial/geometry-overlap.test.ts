/**
 * "Does this feature overlap the query?" — for every geometry kind, not just areas.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `ring-overlap.ts` answers for POLYGONS ONLY, and over
 * the site corpus that is a minority of features: 3 316 of 10 335 elements are
 * nodes and most of the 6 777 ways are open. A spatial query built on the
 * polygon predicate alone would silently answer "nothing here" for two thirds of
 * the map — the failure mode this package treats as the worst one, because it
 * looks exactly like an empty area.
 *
 * THE CONTRACT IS EXACT, WITH ZERO TOLERANCE (decision 12.2). A point overlaps
 * when it is inside; a line overlaps when it enters or crosses. No width, no
 * buffer. Two consequences the tests below pin deliberately:
 *
 * - **It composes.** A caller wanting tolerance dilates the QUERY, in one place,
 *   rather than every predicate carrying a width that has to be kept in sync
 *   with the renderer.
 * - **A road you are standing on is a zero-width line**, so "what am I looking
 *   at" misses the thing under your feet unless the caller dilates. That is a
 *   caller obligation, and it is written down here rather than discovered.
 *
 * HOLES COUNT, for every kind. A point in a courtyard is not in the building; a
 * path across a clearing is not in the wood. The polygon predicate already
 * handles this and the point and line cases must agree with it, or the same
 * query returns different answers depending on how a feature happens to be
 * tagged.
