/**
 * The exact overlap predicate: ring vs ring, and polygon vs polygon with holes.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The spatial index's narrow phase needs "do these two
 * shapes share any area", exactly, and every candidate structure needs it
 * whatever its broad phase turns out to be. `cell-overlap.ts` already contained
 * the ring-vs-ring half — everything below its `boundaryOf` call was already
 * operating on two plain point arrays — so this hoists that out and adds the one
 * genuinely new case: HOLES.
 *
 * THE HOLE CASE IS THE WHOLE POINT, and it is the one a naive composite gets
 * wrong. A shape sitting entirely inside another's hole passes every
 * ring-vs-ring test against the outer ring — a vertex is "inside", the edges do
 * not cross — and shares no area at all. A courtyard, a clearing in a wood, a
 * lake in an island: all real, all common in OSM.
 *
 * WHY NOT JUST TRUST THE THREE WITNESSES. They are complete for SIMPLE
 * polygons: A-inside-B fires witness 2, B-inside-A fires witness 1, and a
 * partial overlap fires witness 3. Holes break that completeness, and nothing
 * about the witnesses says so — which is exactly the kind of silent wrongness
 * this package treats as the worst failure mode.
