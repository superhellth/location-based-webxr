# `spatial/clip.ts`

## Purpose

Clips geometry to a bounding box, so coverage cost is bounded by the area of
interest rather than by the feature.

## Public API

- `clipToBbox(geometry, bbox): OsmGeometry | undefined`
- `boundsOf(positions): Bbox | undefined`
- `positionsOf(geometry): Generator<LatLng>`
- `padBbox(bbox, margin)` — symmetric, for margins that are genuinely degree
  quantities.
- `padBboxByAxis(bbox, { lat, lng })` — per-axis, for margins derived from a
  real-world size, which are necessarily asymmetric away from the equator.
- `metresToDegrees(latitudeDeg, metres)` → `{ lat, lng }`. The one definition of
  metres-per-degree in the package. `cellPaddingDegrees` (`resolutions.ts`) and
  the demo worker's plate-clip box both derived this independently, each with its
  own `111_320`, until PR #236; pass the latitude furthest from the equator that
  the result must cover. At the poles it returns a very large longitude figure
  rather than dividing by zero, which keeps everything — the safe direction.
  - **The latitude is clamped to ±90 before the cosine** (PR #237). Callers
    compute the poleward edge as `|centre| + halfWidth`, which crosses 90° near
    the pole; past 90° `cos` goes negative and the margin inverts, producing a
    box whose `west` is east of its `east` — a clip that keeps nothing, in the
    one place on earth where an empty result looks entirely plausible.
- `bboxesIntersect(a, b)`

## Invariants & assumptions

- **Not an optimisation — a correctness requirement in practice.** Without it,
  indexing the `beach` fixture (a single element containing the entire North
  Sea) attempts a res-13 cover on the order of 10^10 cells. This was found by the
  per-chunk cost test hanging, not by review.
- **Sutherland–Hodgman, which is convex-clip-only — and a bbox is convex**, so
  that limitation does not apply here. It can emit degenerate "seams" for concave
  subjects.
  - **THAT ARTEFACT IS NO LONGER IRRELEVANT.** This bullet used to end "and a
    zero-width seam covers only cells its neighbours already cover", which was
    true while h3 coverage was the only consumer. Since `2262e6a`,
    `mesh/plates.ts` clips and triangulates the result — the rendering path the
    artefact does matter for. Withdrawn rather than deleted, so a reader who
    remembers the old guarantee sees that it was retired on purpose.
  - **`clipRings` guards the case where the two consumers actually disagreed.**
    Outer and inner rings are clipped independently, so `outer ⊇ hole ⊇ bbox`
    clips BOTH to the box rectangle: a hole coincident with its own outer ring.
    That covers nothing when rasterised but triangulates to a SOLID FILL — the
    whole ground plate painted as forest while the user stands in the clearing.
    Since `hole ⊆ outer` survives clipping, `Σ area(holes) ≤ area(outer)` always,
    and equality is exactly this case; the polygon is dropped. Found on PR #236,
    fixed here rather than in `plates.ts` because the coverage path would
    mis-index the same feature.
- **Linestring clipping is a deliberately coarse SEGMENT test**: a segment is
  kept, with both its endpoints, when Cohen–Sutherland says it touches the box —
  not the exact intersection points, and not a test on the vertices. The earlier
  vertex rule ("keep a vertex if it or either neighbour is inside") dropped any
  segment that crossed the box with no vertex near it, which silently deleted
  every long way crossing the working set. Over-keeping costs a few cells that
  are then filtered; under-keeping would lose road.
- **The kept segments are returned as CONTIGUOUS RUNS, never flattened into one
  line.** A way that crosses the box, wanders off and comes back keeps indices
  `{0,1,2, 5,6}`; joining those into a single linestring fabricates the chord
  `2→5`, a segment the way never had, running straight across the box.
  `addLineString` supercovers every consecutive pair, so that chord becomes
  cells **inside** the working set — where, unlike the over-kept ones, nothing
  filters them, and the feature scores ground it never crossed.
  - Hence `MultiLineStringGeometry`: several runs need to be representable as
    _disconnected_. A single run still collapses back to a plain `linestring`,
    so the common case is unchanged for every consumer.
  - `coverCells` covers each run separately and unions the result — covering
    them as one sequence would simply move the fabrication downstream.
- Callers whose box came from cell CENTRES must pad it by however far a cell
  reaches past its own centre, or the clip cuts inside a cell the restriction
  actually asks about and that cell silently loses coverage.
  - Use **`padBboxByAxis` with `cellPaddingDegrees`** (`resolutions.ts`), which
    derives the reach from the grid. A single scalar margin cannot be right
    everywhere: a distance is more degrees of longitude the further from the
    equator, so `padBbox`'s symmetric margin is only usable when the margin is
    genuinely a degree quantity rather than a real-world size.
  - `h3-feature-index` used a flat `0.0005°` (~55.7 m) until 2026-07-31,
    justified against the 28.7 m res-11 CHUNK edge — but it bounds res-13
    cells, whose reach is 3.72 m. Right by accident, and under-padded above
    ~80° N/S where that fixed degree margin falls below one cell in longitude.
- Returns `undefined` rather than an empty geometry when nothing remains, so the
  caller's `continue` is unambiguous.

## Examples

```ts
const bounds = boundsOf(cells.map(cellCentre))!;
const worstLat = Math.max(Math.abs(bounds.north), Math.abs(bounds.south));
const interest = padBboxByAxis(bounds, cellPaddingDegrees(res, worstLat));
const clipped = clipToBbox(geometry, interest);
if (clipped === undefined) continue; // nothing of this feature is in range
```

## Tests

Covered through `h3-feature-index.test.ts` and `chunk-cost.test.ts` — the
behaviour that matters is "indexing a continental feature against a working set
terminates and yields only working-set cells".
