/**
 * Cell-coverage property tests.
 *
 * Why these tests matter:
 * The example tests pin one location and a few hand-built shapes. Real OSM
 * geometry is arbitrary: rings wound either way, features spanning a metre or a
 * kilometre, ways with repeated vertices, polygons at any latitude. These assert
 * the relations that must hold for ALL of that — in particular monotonicity,
 * which is the one an optimisation is most likely to break, and the mode
 * ordering, which is what makes `containmentOverlapping` the right choice rather
 * than merely a choice.

/**
 * SCOPED TIMEOUT, and the mechanism behind it is worth stating correctly.
 *
 * These are correctness checks, not latency checks — but vitest's default 5 s
 * per-test budget IS a wall-clock assertion, and this repo has already paid for
 * one of those (a per-chunk cost test failed the cascade at 104 ms against a
 * "generous" 100 ms ceiling). This suite failed the root cascade twice in four
 * runs while passing 31 consecutive standalone runs.
 *
 * **The contention is NOT the cascade running package gates concurrently.**
 * `run-gate.mjs` is a sequential `for (const stage of project.stages)` with
 * fail-fast, and the root project runs one `pnpm --filter <pkg> test` at a time.
 * It comes one level down: vitest forks a worker pool across this package's test
 * files, and a framework build plus a Playwright browser from preceding stages
 * may still be releasing resources. That is a different thing to go looking at
 * if this recurs, which is why the wrong mechanism was worth correcting.
 *
 * Scoped here rather than set package-wide so a genuinely hung test elsewhere
 * still fails in 5 s rather than 30.
 *
 * **Honest caveat:** the failing run's message was never captured, so "timeout
 * under contention" is the best-supported explanation rather than a proven one.
 * A longer budget cannot mask a real counterexample — a failed assertion still
 * fails — so it is safe either way. If it recurs, capture the failure text
 * before doing anything else.
