/**
 * The unit of network fetching and raw-data caching.
 *
 * Edge 1406.5 m, area 5.161 km², 2.81 km across, inradius (centre to edge
 * midpoint) 1218 m.
 *
 * RAISED FROM 8 TO 7 on 2026-07-28 (owner decision, plan §2.3 / §5.1.1): fetch
 * and cache too much around the user rather than too little, because bytes are
 * cheap and Overpass requests are not. One res-7 cell covers what a 7-tile ring
 * of res-8 cells covered, so this is one request per move instead of seven —
 * and moves are ~7x rarer because a res-7 cell is crossed far less often.
 *
 * **RE-OPENED AND RE-CONFIRMED ON 2026-08-19, this time with a measurement of
 * the alternative rather than an argument against it** (DEC-T4/DEC-T11; the
 * twelfth testing session asked for res 8 to be reconsidered). Measured on the
 * `areal-only` form, FOSSGIS medians:
 *
 * - res 7 — 21.2 MB — **27.7 s** (n=4)
 * - res 8 — 4.58 MB — **21.6 s** (n=5)
 * - res 10 — 0.33 MB — **~21.5 s**
 *
 * **Latency here is almost entirely FIXED COST.** A res-10 cell is 1/343 the
 * area and 1/64 the payload of a res-7 cell and takes the same time. So res 8
 * buys 6 s on the first tile and costs 3.1x on the SAME ground — seven cells
 * against two concurrent slots is ~86 s — plus seven times the requests. The
 * 2026-07-28 decision stands, now for a measured reason.
 *
 * That finding has a consequence beyond this constant, recorded here because
 * this comment is where the next person will look: **asking Overpass for less
 * ground does not make it answer sooner.** Any plan whose speed-up is "fetch a
 * smaller area" is already refuted; see
 * `GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-08-19-0430-overpass-endpoint-and-resolution-remeasure-results.md`.
 *
 * **A res-7 tile is ~21 MB of decompressed JSON.** That figure — not the
 * request — is the number to design against; it is why parsing belongs in a
 * worker. It is the sturdiest number in this package: 21.1 MB in the 2026-08-01
 * matrix sweep and 20.97–21.11 MB in the 2026-08-03 re-run, replicating to
 * three significant figures across three separate runs under `areal-only`.
 *
 * **LATENCY IS A RANGE, DELIBERATELY NOT A MEDIAN: ~15–90 s, and it does not
 * replicate.** The four successful `areal-only` res-7 fetches in
 * `docs/overpass-matrix-sweep.json` are 15.1 / 32.9 / 82.9 / 91.1 s, alongside
 * two 504s — and the 2026-08-03 re-run's own §2b records medians 4.6x the
 * morning's on identical work, concluding that **"the bytes replicate to three
 * significant figures; the timings do not replicate at all"**. Design for the
 * 90 s end. A single latency quoted here is quoting noise.
 *
 * SUPERSEDED FIGURES, kept because this comment has now been wrong three times
 * and every wrong version is still quotable elsewhere:
 *
 * - **"~68 MB, 23–110 s" is retracted** — that is the pre-F32 `nwr` form, which
 *   took every relation touching the bbox. `overpass-query.ts` adopted
 *   areal-only on 2026-08-03; the payload fell 3.2x, provably without changing
 *   a single cell score. **Whether latency moved with it is unknown** — the two
 *   forms were never timed under comparable load.
 * - **"18.2 s and 28.31 MB (21,847 elements)" is retracted** (N2, W2). It was
 *   under half even the `nwr` payload and had no host, query or artefact behind
 *   it; where it came from is not recoverable, most plausibly a narrower key
 *   list than `OVERPASS_SELECT_KEYS` at the time.
 * - **"~20 s median" is retracted, and it lasted one day (2026-08-11).** This
 *   comment carried it and fifteen other sites copied it. It came from
 *   `overpass-query.ts`'s own prose rather than from an artefact; it was the
 *   fastest sample of three non-replicating runs rather than a median; and the
 *   (itself retracted) `18–110 s` string it replaced bracketed the real
 *   distribution better than it did.
 *   **A correction sourced from another comment is not a correction.**
 *
 * See `GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-08-01-1324-overpass-matrix-sweep-results.md`
 * §1 for the per-form byte table — it has no latency column at all, and that
 * absence is what the third retraction above turned on —
 * `GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-08-03-0802-overpass-matrix-sweep-rerun-results.md`
 * §2b for the non-replication finding, and
 * `GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-08-11-0717-osm-demo-click-path-stage-timing-plan.md`
 * §8 for why a stale figure here is a defect rather than untidiness: this
 * comment is the most quotable source for the number, so a plan written from it
 * inherits whatever it says.

 * **RAISED ON A FIELD REPORT, once the build got fast enough to afford it.**
 * Three performance commits (typed-array mesh accumulators, an indexed POI
 * host join, an indexed building part-to-outline assignment) removed the cost
 * that justified stopping at 4, and the reporter asked for "noch einen
 * weiteren Ring oder vielleicht sogar zwei".
 *
 * **THE CONSTRAINT THAT ALMOST STOPPED THIS WAS MISREAD, and the correction is
 * why 6 rather than 5.** A first draft argued the grid must stay under
 * `AR_FOG_NEAR_M = 400`. That is where AR's fade BEGINS; a `fog: false`
 * material never fades and clips at `AR_CAMERA_FAR_M = 1000`. Against the real
 * ceiling ~326 m is comfortable. A second draft argued from the ~10 ms
 * per-chunk frame budget, which is the cost of ONE chunk and does not move
 * with the ring count at all.
 *
 * ⚠️ **IT ALSO RAISES THE SCORE-CACHE CEILING, which is a separate decision
 * the owner took knowingly.** `affordance-index.ts` derives
 * `CHUNKS_PER_WORKING_SET` from this constant, so the retained-chunk cap goes
 * 488 -> 1 016 and the `scoresByCell` ceiling 23 912 -> 49 784 cells. At the
 * corpus-measured 808 bytes/cell that is ~19.3 MB -> ~40 MB serialised, and
 * `chunk-cap.corpus.test.ts` warns real heap is several times that. That test
 * bounds per-chunk cost only, so **no gate asserts the total** - a phone-side
 * eviction would arrive as a field report rather than a red test.
 *
 * **Network cost is mitigated by ordering, not avoided:** a wider outermost
 * ring straddles res-7 fetch boundaries more often, and each new tile is
 * ~21 MB / 15-90 s. Ring 6 is emitted LAST, so a stall there delays the outer
 * ring rather than the first answer.
 *
 * **`SCORE_DISK_RADIUS` is still what the FIRST pass scores, and that is the
 * point rather than an implementation detail.** The rings beyond it are scored
 * afterwards and emitted as they finish, so the extra reach costs nothing at the
 * moment the user is actually waiting. Making the first answer slower in order
 * to make the rings uniform would trade the thing people notice for the thing
 * they do not.
 *
 * The C# reference's analogue is one ring of ~153 m tiles around a ~153 m
 * centre; two extra rings here is the same shape at this grid's scale.

 * How far, in DEGREES, a cell at `resolution` can reach beyond its own centre.
 *

 * lying outside that bbox, and clipping to it would drop coverage the cell
 * genuinely has. Padding by this closes the gap.
 *
 * WHY A FACTOR OF 2, AND WHY IT IS A BOUND RATHER THAN A GUESS. A regular
 * hexagon's circumradius equals its edge length, so `getHexagonEdgeLengthAvg` is
 * the right scale; real H3 cells vary around that average, so it is scaled up.
 * Measured 2026-07-31 over 60 000 cells sampled uniformly on the sphere at
 * res 13: the largest centre→vertex distance is 4.514 m against a 4.092 m
 * average edge, a ratio of **1.103**. The twelve pentagons and their two-rings —
 * the known distortion case — are SMALLER (0.859×), not larger. A factor of 2
 * therefore clears the measured worst case by 1.8×, and `resolutions.property.test.ts`
 * pins the ratio so an h3 upgrade that changed cell geometry fails there rather
 * than silently dropping coverage.
 *
 * WHY THE TWO AXES DIFFER. A degree of longitude shortens with latitude, so the
 * same distance is MORE degrees the further from the equator — which is why a
 * single fixed degree margin cannot be correct everywhere. `worstLatitudeDeg`
 * should be the bbox corner furthest from the equator, so the padding is
 * sufficient across the whole box.
 *
 * AT THE POLES this degrades safely rather than breaking: `cos` approaches zero,
 * so the longitude padding grows without bound and the clip keeps everything.
 * Over-keeping costs time (and the caller's own oversize guard still applies);
 * under-keeping would lose real coverage, which is the failure this exists to
