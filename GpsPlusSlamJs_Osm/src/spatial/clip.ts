/**
 * Clipping geometry to a bounding box.

 * computed at res 13 (4 m cells) but only ever *read* over a ~931-cell working
 * set. Without clipping, covering a feature costs time proportional to the
 * FEATURE's size rather than the working set's — and OSM contains features of
 * continental extent. The `beach` fixture is the proof: a single element, the
 * entire North Sea relation, whose res-13 coverage is on the order of 10^10
 * cells. Filtering that down to the working set afterwards is not slow, it is
 * non-terminating in any practical sense.
 *
 * So the area of interest is applied FIRST, to the geometry, and only the
 * clipped remainder is handed to H3.

 * today with nothing asserting they always will" shape that the same PR moved
 * `TERRAIN_EXTENT_M` to avoid. Raised on PR #236.
 *
 * Longitude degrees shorten with latitude, so the same distance is MORE degrees
 * the further from the equator; pass the latitude furthest from the equator that
 * the result has to cover, or the box is short at its far edge.
 *
 * AT THE POLES this degrades safely rather than breaking: `cos` approaches zero
 * (in floating point ~6.1e-17 at exactly 90°, never 0), so the longitude figure
 * grows very large and any box built from it keeps everything. Over-keeping
 * costs time; under-keeping would silently lose geometry, which is the failure
 * this exists to prevent.
 *
 * PAST THE POLE IT IS CLAMPED, and that is not hypothetical (PR #237). Asking
 * for the poleward edge means callers compute `|centre| + halfWidth`, which
 * crosses 90° for any box near the pole — and beyond 90° `cos` goes NEGATIVE,
 * so the margin inverts and the "box" it builds has `west` east of `east`. A
 * clip against that keeps nothing, and an empty result near the pole reads as
 * "no OSM data here", which is exactly plausible enough to never be
 * investigated. Clamping keeps the contract above true for every input.
