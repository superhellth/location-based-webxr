/**
 * Feature-index tests.
 *
 * Why these tests matter:
 * Two behaviours here decide whether the package survives real data. A feature
 * whose geometry cannot be built must be RECORDED rather than thrown — the C#
 * reference throws, and the planet contains relations that cannot be closed, so
 * one of them would blank an entire working set. And the `restrictTo` bound is
 * what keeps the index cheap: a res-7 tile holds ~117k affordance cells against
 * a ~931-cell working set, so indexing everything would do 126× the necessary
 * work.
