/**
 * Do two shapes share any area? The exact overlap predicate.
 *
 * The narrow phase every spatial query needs: a broad phase proposes candidates
 * by bounding box, and this decides. It is deliberately separate from any index,
 * because every candidate structure needs it and none of them changes it.
 *
 * WHERE IT CAME FROM. `cell-overlap.ts` has covered a ring against an H3
 * hexagon since 2026-08-09, and everything in that test below the point where
 * the hexagon's boundary was fetched was already operating on two plain point
 * arrays — the cell was incidental. This is that predicate, named for what it
 * actually does, plus the one case it could not express.
 *
 * THE THREE WITNESSES, and why all three are needed. Two rings share area when:
 *
 * 1. a vertex of B lies inside A — covers B inside A, and the general case;
 * 2. a vertex of A lies inside B — covers A inside B, which (1) alone misses
 *    entirely, and which is exactly half the containment cases;
 * 3. an edge of A crosses an edge of B — covers a partial overlap where the
 *    overlapping region contains no vertex of either, which neither (1) nor (2)
 *    can see. Two boxes crossing in a plus shape is the everyday example.
 *
 * They are COMPLETE for simple polygons. They are not complete once holes exist,
 * which is the whole reason `polygonsOverlap` is a separate function rather than
 * a loop over rings.
 *
 * TOUCHING COUNTS AS OVERLAPPING, inherited from `segment-crossing.ts` and
 * deliberate: OSM is full of shared edges — terraced buildings, a fence along a
 * parcel boundary — and for the navigation and query uses here, refusing to
 * admit a shape that grazes another is the safe direction.
 *
 * PLANAR ON LAT/LNG, for the reason `point-in-ring.ts` gives: containment and
 * crossing are invariant under the affine map from degrees to local metres, so
 * no projection is needed for a boolean answer.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT ANSWER, and it is most of the planet. `osm-geometry.ts` has
 * five geometry kinds and this covers ONE. Over the site corpus, 3 316 of 10 335
 * elements are nodes and most of the 6 777 ways are open — so a spatial query
 * built on this alone would answer for a minority of features.
 *
 * **A caller must not hand an open way's points in as a ring.** Nothing here can
 * tell a closed ring from an open line, so a road passed as a ring is silently
 * given an interior it does not have, and a query "is this inside" gets a
 * confident wrong answer.
 *
 * **USE `geometry-overlap.ts` UNLESS YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A POLYGON.**
 * `geometryOverlaps` dispatches on `OsmGeometry`'s five kinds and cannot be
 * handed the wrong one — a point overlaps when it is inside, a line when it
 * enters or crosses, an area through `polygonsOverlap` here. This file is its
 * areal case, kept separate because `cell-overlap.ts` needs exactly that and
 * nothing more.
 *
