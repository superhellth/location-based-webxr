/**
 * Tall structures that are not tagged as buildings — F34, §5.
 *
 * THE CASE THAT NAMED THIS FILE. Cologne Cathedral has two 157 m towers and only
 * one of them draws:
 *
 * - `way/645732604` "Nordturm" — `building=tower` **and** `man_made=tower`.
 * - `way/645732603` "Südturm" — `man_made=tower` **only**.
 *
 * `isBuilding` keys off `building`, so one is extruded and one is not. A
 * cathedral with a single tower reads as a failed fetch rather than as a tagging
 * distinction, and the general case — chimneys, masts, silos, storage tanks,
 * water towers — is the same gap at smaller scale.
 *
 * **THIS IS NOT A PORT, AND THAT IS WORTH KNOWING BEFORE TRUSTING IT.** §5.2 of
 * the round-6 plan read streets-gl in full: its `OSMAreaQualifierFactory` has no
 * `man_made` branch, so its Südturm is missing too. Nothing external supplies
 * the tag list or the height conventions here — which is why the list is short
 * and closed, and why most of the tests are about what must NOT be drawn.
 *
 * TWO EXCLUSIONS DO THE REAL WORK, and both prevent a DOUBLE draw rather than a
 * wrong one:
 *
 * - Anything `isBuilding` already claims. Otherwise the Nordturm is extruded
 *   twice in the same place, which is invisible until it z-fights.
 * - Anything that is a `building:part`. The five `Südturm (Sockel)` parts reach
 *   70.95 m and belong to the part path.
