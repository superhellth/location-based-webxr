/**
 * The `M` variants — ported from `poi-markers.html` (DEC-R6-30…33).
 *
 * Four of the owner's 51 liked pairs come from this file. It is the most
 * self-documenting of the six: it states its own conventions in a header
 * comment — _"Convention: metres, Y-up, +Z front, origin on footprint centre.
 * For bx/cy/co the `y` argument is the BOTTOM of the part (before rotation);
 * for ic/qz/qy/dy it is the centre."_ — and those are what the helpers below
 * undo.
 *
 * **NOTHING IS SUBTRACTED**, as in `B` and unlike `D` and `P`. M builds each
 * payload from `y = 0` and translates the merged result by `PLINTH_H` at
 * assembly, so the payload coordinates are already ground-relative. Subtracting
 * a plinth height anyway would sink every model by 23 cm.
 *
 * **Cylinders are top-radius-first**, as in `D` and `P` and unlike `B`. `cyM`
 * swaps them once.
 *
 * **`y` is the BOTTOM *before* rotation.** M composes `T · R · S` with the
 * translation at `y + h/2`, so a rotated part turns about its own centre and
 * then has that centre placed. The helpers reproduce exactly that, which is why
 * they emit at `-h/2` under a transform rather than at `y`.
 *
 * **THE ACCENT IS RESOLVED HERE.** M's builders take an `accent` argument and
 * the renderer supplies it from a `FAMILY` table — `move` for transport, `green`
 * for open space, `food`, `culture`. Each port below bakes in the colour its
 * kind's family resolves to, named in a comment, because a variant is one fixed
 * mesh and there is no family to look up at build time.
 *
 * @see poi-variants-m.ts.md
