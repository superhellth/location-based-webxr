/**
 * Barrier footprints — turning a line into something with width.
 *
 * Why these tests matter:
 * A barrier is an open WAY, not a ring, so it has no footprint until one is
 * given to it. Everything downstream depends on that footprint being sane:
 * `extrudeBuilding` needs closed rings with real area, and pass B's
 * point-in-obstacle test needs a polygon that actually contains the wall.
 *
 * The shape choice is the substance here — one quad per segment rather than a
 * single buffered outline — and the reason is the case a mitred outline gets
 * wrong: a sharp turn sends the mitre point towards infinity, producing a spike
 * far from the wall that obstructs ground nobody walled off. These tests pin
 * that a hairpin stays local.
 *
 * @see barrier-shape.ts.md

 * `signedArea2` already had the identical convention, and `buildings.ts` has a
