/**
 * A multi-level uniform grid over host-candidate bounding boxes, so a marker
 * only meets the candidates that could possibly contain it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `annotatePoiHosts` walked every (marker, candidate) pair. Its
 * broad phase is four float compares, so the constant is tiny — but the shape is
 * `markers × candidates` and BOTH grow with the working set, so four times the
 * data is sixteen times the work. Measured 2026-08-22 on the replicated
 * `london-westminster` fixture: 240 × 4 768 pairs cost 10.5 ms and 960 × 19 072
 * cost 197.2 ms — 16× the pairs for 18.9× the time, which is the quadratic
 * stated plainly. It was 17.3 % of the demo's whole mesh build.
 *
 * **WHY MULTI-LEVEL, WHICH IS THE ONE DESIGN DECISION HERE.** OSM footprint size
 * is unbounded, so a single pitch cannot serve both a 12 m house and a 400 m
 * relation: a candidate far larger than the pitch has to be written into
 * hundreds of cells. The obvious guard — hold oversized candidates out in a flat
 * list checked by every marker — was implemented first and MEASURED, and it
 * reintroduced the very quadratic this file exists to remove:
 *
 * - at 1 copy of the fixture, 1 candidate overflowed; at 9 copies, 9 did
 * - so `markers × overflow` was 60 pairs against **4 860** — **72 % of all
 *   remaining pairs at 9 copies**, growing as the product again
 *
 * Levels fix it at the root. A candidate is inserted at the finest level whose
 * cells it does not flood, so a big footprint lands in one or two coarse cells
 * instead of hundreds of fine ones, and every level is still a point lookup. The
 * flat overflow list survives only as a backstop for geometry too large for even
 * the coarsest level, which at the factors below means wider than ~27 km.
 *
 * **ORDER IS THE HARD CONSTRAINT, NOT SPEED.** `annotatePoiHosts` must produce
 * each marker's hosts in CANDIDATE order, because the caller orders candidates
 * buildings-first and takes the first enabled host — a café inside a building
 * that stands on a landuse plate belongs to the building. So this index cannot
 * return a bag of hits: candidates are inserted in index order, so every cell's
 * list is ascending, and the per-level lists are **merged** rather than
 * concatenated, because concatenating would place a coarse-level plate after a
 * fine-level building that follows it in candidate order.
 *

 * here knows what a coordinate means: `annotatePoiHosts` passes ENU metres and
 * `assignPartsToOutlines` is generic over the frame, so `solidBuildingFootprints`
 * passes **lat/lng degrees**, where a building's mean extent is ~0.0001 and a
 * floor of 8 makes one cell cover the planet. The index then pruned nothing and
 * cost its own overhead: measured **+16.8 %** on that caller, a real regression
 * that the metric caller could not show.
 *
 * A floor is not needed for its stated purpose either. Tiny footprints want a
 * fine pitch — one cell each is the ideal, not a hazard. The only degenerate
 * case is a mean extent of exactly zero, i.e. every candidate a point, and any
 * positive pitch is correct there because correctness never depends on the
