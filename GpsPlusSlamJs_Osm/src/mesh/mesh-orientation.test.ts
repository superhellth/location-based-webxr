/**
 * Winding and normals, checked as INVARIANTS rather than per-shape expectations.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `buildings.test.ts` already asserts triangle counts,
 * bounding boxes in metres, and that wall normals are horizontal — and every one
 * of those passed while every wall quad in the package was wound inside-out.
 * They could not have failed: a count is blind to orientation, and "ny === 0"
 * is equally true of an outward normal and its negation.
 *
 * The reason orientation is easy to get wrong here: the emitters work in the
 * ENU frame, and with Y up a counter-clockwise loop in `(east, north)` reads as
 * *clockwise* seen from +Y. `flatCap` and `addCap` compensate by emitting
 * `(a, c, b)`; anything that emits `(a, b, c)` on ENU-ordered points is
 * silently reversed. Nothing in the type system says so, so it has to be a test.
 *
 * Separately, `MeshBuilder` reflects ENU→render (`z → -z`) so the published
 * frame is right-handed with north at −z. The last describe block pins THAT,
 * and it is the only test here that ties the mesh to the real world: every
 * other one compares a mesh against itself, and those all hold just as well in
 * a mirrored world — which is how a mirrored frame shipped unnoticed.
 *
 * The two invariants below are deliberately shape-agnostic, because the failure
 * is not about pyramids or gables — it is about that one mapping, and any new
 * roof shape will meet it too:
 *
 * 1. **The assigned normal agrees with the emitted winding.** Otherwise the
 *    surface is lit as if it faced one way and culled as if it faced the other.
 * 2. **Normals point away from the inside of the volume.** Otherwise the
 *    building is inside-out: correct in silhouette, invisible or black under
 *    backface culling.
 *
 * Neither is caught by rendering the demo, because `building-view.ts` sets
 * `side: THREE.DoubleSide` — which is there to make a *wrongly wound* wall show
 * up as a shading oddity instead of a hole, and therefore also hides it.
