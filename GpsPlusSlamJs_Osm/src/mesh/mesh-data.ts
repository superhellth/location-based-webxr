 * **THE ENU→RENDER REFLECTION LIVES HERE, AND ONLY HERE.** Callers hand in ENU
 * coordinates — `(east, up, north)` — and the builder emits the right-handed
 * render frame `(east, up, −north)`. That is a reflection, `diag(1, 1, -1)`,
 * and it is applied in one place on purpose:
 *
 * - A reflection does not commute with the cross product the way a rotation
 *   does. For `det(M) = -1`, `cross(Mu, Mv) = -M(u × v)`. So mirroring the
 *   positions and normals ALONE would leave every triangle wound against its
 *   own normal — lit correctly and culled backwards, the hardest class of
 *   geometry bug to see, because the screenshot a developer reaches for as
 *   proof is exactly the artefact that hides it.
 * - `triangle()` therefore reverses, cancelling that sign. The pair is what
 *   makes the transform correct, and neither half is meaningful alone.
 *
 * Doing it centrally rather than at each of the eleven emission sites is
 * deliberate and was measured against the alternative: the emitters do NOT
 * express their orientation uniformly. Some compensate by index order
 * (`extrude.ts` walls), others by choosing the corner order of `p, q, r, s`
 * (`roof.ts` slopes, which then emit natural `(i0, i1, i2)`). "Delete the
 * reversals" is therefore not a mechanical edit, while one reflection at the
 * boundary is provably complete — no emitter can be missed because no emitter
