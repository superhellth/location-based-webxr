/**
 * `barrier-gates.ts` — where a mapped gate opens a wall.
 *
 * Why this test matters:
 * The eighth testing session reported ways crossing barriers with no opening,
 * and offered a hypothesis the code ruled out: the OSM way really is continuous
 * there. So the question stopped being "are we drawing it wrong" and became
 * "when may we cut". DEC-R12-1 answers it as narrowly as possible — ONLY where
 * OSM explicitly maps a gate or entrance node on the barrier's own way — because
 * the measured alternative (cut at any way crossing) would invent openings, and
 * an invented opening lets an agent walk through a wall that is really there.
 *
 * The assertions below are therefore mostly about what does NOT open: a gate
 * near a wall, a gate on a different way, a gate mapped as a way rather than a
 * node, and a bollard (excluded by DEC-R12-7 for buying one opening across the
 * whole corpus while being the one value that could invent a hole).
 *
