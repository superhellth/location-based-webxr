/**
 * WHY THESE TESTS MATTER (W16–W19). Fifty models is fifty chances to ship a
 * shape that renders happily and is wrong — inside out, half-buried, a hundred
 * metres tall, or silently empty. None of those throw, and none of them are
 * visible at the six fixture sites unless that particular tag happens to be
 * mapped there, which for most of the fifty it is not (DEC-R4-14 accepted that
 * risk explicitly by declining a contact sheet).
 *
 * So the contract is enforced by ITERATION over the registry rather than by
 * fifty hand-written tests: a model added without satisfying it fails on
 * registration, and no one has to remember to write its test.
 *
 * The ranking gets the same treatment. It is committed rather than derived at
 * runtime — the sheet is publicly editable and the set of models that exist must
 * not depend on it — so something has to notice when the two drift.
