/**
 * Tree placement, as instancing data.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS THE EASIEST WIN IN THE WHOLE 3D PLAN. Trees are the one part of
 * §8 that is straightforwardly a win on mobile: they are numerous, identical up
 * to a transform, and therefore exactly what `InstancedMesh` exists for. A few
 * shared geometries plus per-instance matrices draws a forest in one call.
 *
 * SO THIS FILE EMITS NO GEOMETRY AT ALL. It emits placements — position,
 * rotation, scale, variant — and the consumer app builds however many shared
 * `BufferGeometry` variants it wants. That keeps the package free of `three`
 * (plan §4.2) and keeps the interesting decisions (billboard vs. real geometry,
 * LOD distance) where the renderer is.
 *
 * DETERMINISM IS A FEATURE, NOT AN ACCIDENT. OSM2World seeds its randomness
 * from the tree's position or area id so the same tree looks the same on every
 * run. We do the same, for a sharper reason: this is an AR overlay used to
 * judge pose accuracy, and a forest that reshuffles itself between frames — or
 * between two devices looking at the same place — is useless for that. The hash
 * is therefore part of the contract, not an implementation detail.
 *
 * THE HASH MOVED TO `stable-jitter.ts` (§4a, DEC-R6-20) and is no longer
 * declared here. It was written for trees; POI markers now need exactly the
 * same thing, and two copies of a hash are two hashes that can drift apart
 * invisibly — both would still look random. The salt constants live there too,
 * so `poi.ts` and this file cannot disagree about which salt means "yaw".
 *
