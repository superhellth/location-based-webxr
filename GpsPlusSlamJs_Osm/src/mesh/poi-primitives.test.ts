/**
 * WHY THESE TESTS MATTER (§4, DEC-R6-11/R6-15). Our vocabulary had no quads, no
 * discs, no pyramids and no rounded solids, and those are exactly what the
 * prototypes use to get their detail — so 34 models are about to be rebuilt on
 * primitives that have never existed before. A primitive that is subtly wrong is
 * multiplied by every model that composes it, and the three ways it can be wrong
 * are all invisible in a status line:
 *
 * - **Inside out.** Lit correctly, culled backwards. The object vanishes the
 *   moment a renderer turns culling on, which is the default.
 * - **Wrong size or off-origin.** `poi-models.test.ts` asserts every model sits
 *   ON the ground with its base at `y = 0`, so a primitive that emits around its
 *   own centre buries half of every model that uses it.
 * - **Degenerate.** A zero-area triangle produces NaN normals downstream, and
 *   NaN in an instance transform REMOVES the object with nothing reported.
 *
 * Each primitive is therefore checked for the same three things the plan asked
 * for — vertex count, bounding box, outward winding — plus finiteness.
