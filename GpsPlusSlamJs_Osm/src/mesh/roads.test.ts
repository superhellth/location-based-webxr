/**
 * Road ribbons (W13) — the hardest builder in the round.
 *
 * WHY THE JUNCTION TESTS ARE THE POINT. DEC-R2-13 chose segment quads plus a
 * disc at every vertex instead of mitred joins, and the whole claim of that
 * design is that **it cannot leave a gap, at any angle, with no special cases**.
 * A test counting triangles would pass on geometry full of holes; the property
 * that matters is COVERAGE, so these tests ask "is this point inside the
 * surface" and let the triangle count be whatever it is.
 *
 * WHY THE WIDTH TESTS MATTER SEPARATELY. Width was the round's last open
 * `[confirm]` — proposed with no oracle. `streets-gl` supplied one
 * (2026-07-30-1520-streets-gl-road-modelling-findings.md): width comes from
 * LANES, not from the highway class. These tests pin that model rather than a
 * table of magic numbers, so the reasoning is checkable and the numbers are
 * derived.
