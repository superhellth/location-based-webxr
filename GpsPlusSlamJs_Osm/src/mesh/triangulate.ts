/**
 * Hole-aware ear-clipping triangulation.
 *
 * WHY OURS RATHER THAN `earcut`. The owner's decision is that production code
 * takes no runtime dependency but `h3-js` (plan §4.2). The plan's answer to
 * "then how do you know it is right?" is §4.2.1's comparison harness: `earcut`
 * is a **devDependency** used as a differential oracle and a benchmark, never
 * shipped. Hole-aware ear clipping is named there as the pairing most likely to
 * earn its keep, because it is a classic correctness sink.
 *
 * THE ALGORITHM, and where each part earns its place:
 *
 * 1. **Holes are bridged into the outer ring** before clipping, so the whole
 *    thing becomes one simple polygon. This is the standard approach and it is
 *    also where hand-rolled implementations usually go wrong — the bridge has
 *    to be a segment that intersects nothing.
 * 2. **Ear clipping** on the merged ring: repeatedly remove a convex vertex
 *    whose triangle contains no other vertex.
 * 3. **A progress guard.** Degenerate input (collinear runs, repeated points,
 *    self-touching rings — all of which real OSM contains) can make no vertex
 *    look like a valid ear. Rather than loop forever, the clipper forces the
 *    least-bad ear and records that it did. **Non-termination is the failure
 *    mode that hurts most** — this package already lost a test run to a
 *    coverage call that never finished, and that lesson applies here too.
 *
 * Output is index triples into the input vertex list, so the caller owns the
 * vertex buffer and no coordinates are copied.
 *

 * ribbons all use — three derives the shading FROM that normal, so a collapsed
 * face renders as a black sliver beside its correctly-lit neighbours. That is the
 * mechanism behind a testing session's report of the Thames going black once
 * landuse was switched on.
 *
 * WHERE THEY COME FROM. `spatial/clip.ts` warns that Sutherland–Hodgman "can
 * produce degenerate 'seams' for concave subjects", and since `2262e6a`
 * `mesh/plates.ts` clips and hands the result straight here. A river is the
 * textbook concave subject: `plates-concave.test.ts` reproduces it and finds
 * two collapsed triangles in one meander.
 *
 * WHY DROPPING IS SAFE FOR EVERY CONSUMER, not just the renderer. A zero-area
 * triangle contributes nothing to `triangulatedArea`, covers no H3 cell, and
 * occupies no pixels — it is invisible to everything except the shading it
 * breaks. There is no consumer for which emitting one is better.
 *
 * `forcedEars` is deliberately NOT suppressed alongside it. That counter is the
 * triangulator admitting it could not find a valid ear, which stays true whether
 * or not the resulting triangle is kept — and it is the signal that the INPUT
 * ring was bad, which is a different problem from this output filter.
