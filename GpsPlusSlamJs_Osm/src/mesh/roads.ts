/**
 * Road ribbons (W13, DEC-R2-12 / DEC-R2-13).
 *
 * WHY SEGMENT QUADS PLUS A DISC AT EVERY VERTEX, and not mitred joins. Two quads
 * meeting at an angle leave a wedge of bare ground on the outside of the turn,
 * and closing it properly means computing the mitre — which needs the join angle,
 * a limit for near-reversals, and a special case at every degeneracy. A disc of
 * the road's own width centred on each vertex fills the wedge **by construction,
 * at any angle, with no cases at all**.
 *
 * Its only cost is overlap: the disc is drawn over the quads. DEC-R2-13 already
 * requires roads to be opaque, and overlap is invisible in opaque geometry — so
 * the cost is paid by a decision that was taken for a different reason.
 *
 * `streets-gl` does it the other way and the cost is visible in its file list: a
 * whole `road-graph/` package with an `IntersectionPolygonBuilder` that offsets
 * and pairwise-intersects every incident road. That produces genuinely correct
 * junctions; it is also several hundred lines and the hardest code in their tree.
 * See `2026-07-30-1520-streets-gl-road-modelling-findings.md` §2.
 *
 * WHY `three`'s `Line` IS NOT AN OPTION: `linewidth > 1` is unsupported on every
 * major platform. This is triangulated geometry either way, and that is not a
 * choice being made here.

 * Whether this way is a ground-level crossing carried over something — the

 * **Three earlier formulations of this rule were refuted against real data, so
 * each clause is here for a named way in `testdata/sites/london-tower-bridge.json`:**
 *
 * - **Any truthy `bridge`, not `bridge=yes`.** Tower Bridge's own bascule spans
 *   are `bridge=movable` — 6 of the 14 ground-level ways at the site the rule
 *   was written for. An exact match misses the bridge the place is named after.
 * - **A `highway` is required.** Ways 367652753 / 367653917 are
 *   `bridge=yes building:part=yes min_height=40`, closed areas carrying no way
 *   at all. A bare `bridge=*` rule opens the bank along their whole outline,
 *   from a structure 40 m overhead.
 * - **`layer` must be ground level.** Ways 153173986 / 153173987 ARE
 *   `highway=footway bridge=yes` — and sit at `layer=2`, 43 m up, behind a
 *   turnstile. The highway clause alone admits them.
 *   - Absent `layer` reads as ground level, because that is the tag's default
 *     and most simple bridges carry none. Refusing the absent case would drop
 *     the common bridge to save the rare mis-tagged one.
 *
 * - **BELOW THE SURFACE IS NOT A CROSSING**, and that is decided by the SHARED
 *   {@link isBelowSurface} rather than by a bespoke test here. This rule used to
 *   be `tunnel === "yes"` plus `level <= 1`, which admitted NEGATIVE layers --
 *   so a `highway=* bridge=yes layer=-1` way counted as a ground-level deck and,
 *   through `bridgeDeckLines` -> `addWater`, opened a passage corridor through a
 *   river bank. It also missed `tunnel=culvert`, which `below-surface.ts` has
 *   classified as sub-surface all along.
 *   - The asymmetry was the tell (PR #315 review): `gateOpenings` vetoes a
 *     below-surface gate node and `canCorroborate` vetoes a below-surface way,
 *     while this -- the third sibling rule in the same package -- did not. One
 *     definition now serves all three.
