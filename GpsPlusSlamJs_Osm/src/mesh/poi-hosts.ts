/**
 * Where a POI marker actually goes when the thing it names is already drawn
 * (DEC-S1, DEC-S2, DEC-S6, DEC-S7 — stage 1).
 *
 * THE PROBLEM, IN THE OWNER'S WORDS. _"Wenn jetzt hier eh schon eine Geometrie
 * ist, die das gleiche Label hat … dann ist es ja viel sinnvoller, dass diese
 * geschlossene Fläche entsprechend eingefärbt wird und der POI überhaupt nicht
 * als 3D-Modell angezeigt wird."_ A restaurant node inside a restaurant building
 * is the same fact twice; drawing both puts a marker inside a wall.
 *
 * AND THE BETTER HALF OF THE SAME IDEA, which is what this is really for:
 * _"…wo man dann auf dem Restaurant oben drauf so ein Symbol machen würde, was
 * über dem Restaurant fliegt … dadurch versteht derjenige sofort: ah okay, das
 * Gebäude ist ein Restaurant."_ The marker does not vanish — it moves onto the
 * roof, and the building gains the label it was missing.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A PURE FUNCTION OVER PRE-RESOLVED HOSTS, and not a lookup. Two
 * facts about the pipeline force it, and both were found by reading the code
 * rather than assumed:
 *
 *  - **A layer toggle does NOT re-run the worker.** `main.ts` rebuilds three.js
 *    objects from the CACHED worker payload precisely so that switching a layer
 *    is cheap. So a rule that must know whether `plates` is on cannot live in
 *    the worker, where the geometry is — it would read a stale layer set.
 *  - **Plates are CLIPPED to the rendered extent and built AFTER the markers.**
 *    "A pool way exists in the features" and "a pool plate is drawn" are
 *    different claims: a pool near the tile edge is clipped away entirely. A
 *    resolver matching against features rather than against drawn geometry would
 *    delete the marker and draw nothing — exactly the data loss DEC-S1 exists to
 *    prevent, arriving through the back door.
 *
 * So the worker resolves candidate hosts ONCE PER HOST LAYER and annotates each
 * marker; this function picks between them given the layers actually enabled.
 * That is also what makes the rule testable without a worker, a fetch, or a GPU.
 *

 *
 * **`poi.ts` IS NOT MODIFIED, and that is deliberate.** Its node-ness rule is

 * alone would put a marker in the middle of every car park in the tile"_ — is
 * exactly the behaviour wanted here and still unwanted there. Two builders with
 * two rules, rather than one builder with a flag.
 *
 * **THE ALLOW-LIST IS WHAT KEEPS THEM APART.** `plates.ts` owns every area whose
 * tags match `PLATE_KEYS` — amenity, landuse, leisure, natural, surface,
 * man_made, place, tourism — which OVERLAPS the POI keys rather than being
 * disjoint. A "not a plate" deny-list would therefore let a car park through,
 * since a restaurant building way and a car-park way both carry `amenity`. Only
 * a positive list of kinds that deserve a floating symbol is safe.
