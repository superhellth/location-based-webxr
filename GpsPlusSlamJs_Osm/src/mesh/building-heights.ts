/**
 * Simple 3D Buildings (S3DB) height resolution.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE. The geometry of a building is easy; deciding how
 * TALL it is, and which part of it starts where, is where OSM's real messiness
 * lives. OSM2World devotes a 446-line class (`LevelAndHeightData.java`) to it.
 * Separating it means the extruder is pure geometry and every tagging quirk has
 * one place to live and one place to be tested.
 *
 * THE INSIGHT THAT MAKES S3DB WORTH SUPPORTING AT ALL: landmark detail is FREE
 * if you honour `building:part` and `min_height`. Cologne Cathedral is not a
 * model file and not a special case — it is many `building:part` polygons, each
 * with its own height and `min_height`. A naive one-polygon extrusion gives a
 * box; the same extruder applied per part gives something recognisably
 * cathedral-shaped, with no landmark database anywhere. That is why
 * `building:part` support is first in the plan's ordering (§8, 24 % of buildings
 * in the census) rather than an advanced feature.
 *
 * @see building-heights.ts.md

/**
 * How tall the roof is, including when nothing tags one.
 *
 * THIS DEFAULT IS THE FIX FOR R3-1/R4-7, and its absence is why the finding
 * survived three rounds. `roof:height` and `roof:levels` are both rare, so a
 * zero default meant any part tagged with a real `roof:shape` and only a
 * `height` got `eaveHeightM === totalHeightM` — and the roof generator then
 * built a shape of ZERO height, which for `pyramidal` is a flat cap across the
 * whole footprint rather than a spire.
 *
 * At Cologne Cathedral that is `way/206020152`, the 71 m lower tower body: a
 * flat-topped prism with 59 vertices across its top, standing in front of the
 * spire parts (`min_height` 71, tapering to 157 m) that were always correct.
 * "Twin towers as flat-topped prisms with a finer spire behind them" is the
 * owner's description of exactly that, and the fixture corpus is what finally
 * made it reproducible offline.
 *
 * The ladder is OSM2World's (`LevelAndHeightData`): a single-level building gets
 * 1 m, because a 5 m ridge on a 3 m cottage is most of the building; everything
 * else gets `DEFAULT_RIDGE_HEIGHT` = 5 m. **A flat roof still gets zero**, and
 * that condition is load-bearing rather than tidy — a phantom 5 m of roof on
 * every untagged building would lower its walls by 5 m, which is a far more
 * common case than the one being fixed.
 *
 * KNOWN SIMPLIFICATION: OSM2World gives a dome `outline diameter / 2`. That needs
 * the footprint, which this function does not have and should not take just for
 * this — a dome therefore gets the 5 m ridge too, which is too flat for a large
 * dome and no longer a zero-height cap. Recorded rather than hidden; it is a
 * smaller error than the one being removed.
