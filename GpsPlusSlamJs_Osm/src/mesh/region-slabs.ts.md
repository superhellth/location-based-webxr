# `src/mesh/region-slabs.ts`

## Purpose

Turns merged affordance regions into flat ground overlays (W14; DEC-R2-11 as
reversed by DEC-R7b-7a). It built low SLABS -- a body with a boundary wall, so it
read at a shallow camera angle -- until round 8 removed the extrusion: a region
is a claim about the ground, not an object standing on it.

## Public API

- `SlabRegion` — `{ outline, medianScore, id }`. Structural rather than the full
  `Region`, so this module does not depend on the region builder and a test can
  construct one in three lines.
  - **`id` is load-bearing** (DEC-R7b-3a): it is the only thing that lets a click
    on a slab resolve back to the region it draws. Carried through opaquely —
    this module does not know how ids are formed and must not, or it becomes a
    second place that decides region identity.
- `BuildRegionSlabsOptions` — `{ frame, groundHeightM? }`. **`wallHeightM` was
  removed in round 8** (DEC-R7b-7a) along with the walls it sized.
- `RegionSlab` — `{ medianScore, id, mesh }`. The `id` is the region's, carried
  through so the caller can resolve a click on the mesh back to it.
- `buildRegionSlabs(regions, options) → RegionSlab[]` — one slab per region, in
  input order. Never throws; a degenerate outline yields an empty mesh.

## Invariants & assumptions

- **THE COLOUR IS NOT COMPUTED HERE, and that is the load-bearing decision.** The
  2D map and the 3D view must never be able to disagree about what a score looks
  like — the whole reason the store exists. The demo owns one
  `heatScale`/`heatColour` pair and both views read it; this module carries
  `medianScore` through untouched. A colour computed in the package would be a
  second source of truth for the same question, which is precisely what
  `geo-three`'s two elevation decoders and two Earth radii are cautionary
  examples of.
- **Holes are holes.** A building inside a park is a hole in the region, and that
  is the ordinary shape of the data rather than an edge case. A slab that filled
  its holes would cover the very buildings the view exists to show — and it would
  look deliberate, because a solid coloured surface reads as "this whole area
  scores", a confidently wrong claim rather than a visible glitch.
- **A region can be several polygons.** Two cells that score but do not touch are
  one region with two polygons; taking only the first would silently shrink it.
- **The top surface is wound so its face normal points UP.** `flatShading`
  recomputes the normal from the winding and ignores the per-vertex normals, so
  an inverted top is lit from beneath and culled while every counter still
  reports it — exactly the defect W13's ribbons shipped with for one commit.
- **Terrain is sampled PER VERTEX.** A region can be hundreds of metres across;
  one sample would cut into the hill at one end and float at the other.
- **A ring with fewer than three points is skipped, never triangulated.** Pushing
  on produces `NaN`, and one `NaN` deletes the entire draw call in three.js with
  no error.
- **The slab is FLAT, and carries no lift of its own** (DEC-R7b-7a, round 8).
  Its vertices sit at the sampled ground height; `y = 0` is what that means only
  when no `groundHeightM` sampler is supplied. It used to be a
  body with a 0.5 m boundary wall (DEC-R2-11), because a zero-thickness surface
  disappears edge-on. The owner asked for the extrusion to go: a region is an
  overlay on the ground, not an object standing on it.
  - **The wall height was also the top surface's lift**, so removing the walls
    lowered the surface by 0.5 m as well. Deliberate, and asserted — "drop the
    walls" reads as a pure deletion and is not one.
  - **Separation from the other ground layers is the CALLER's job.** The demo's
    `layer-order.ts` ladder puts `areas` at 0.12 m; lifting here too would
    double-count it.
  - **DEC-R2-11's objection stands unanswered, not refuted.** The plan paired
    this with a 2–3 m lift that would have kept a flat sheet visible edge-on, and
    that lift was cancelled because it broke three `layer-order.ts` invariants.
    If a region reads as absent at a grazing angle, the escalation is opacity,
    then a separate outline — **not** the walls.

## Examples

```ts
const slabs = buildRegionSlabs(snapshot.regions, {
  frame: enuFrameAt(userPosition),
  groundHeightM: (p) => field.heightAt(p),
});
// The CONSUMER colours it, through the same scale the 2D map uses:
const colour = heatColour(scale, slab.medianScore);
```

## Tests

`region-slabs.test.ts` — 8 tests: one slab per region carrying its score; **a
hole stays a hole** (covered inside the outer ring, not covered at the hole's
centre); **the slab is flat, with no lift of its own**; the top drapes per vertex; a
multi-polygon region covers both parts and not the gap; a degenerate outline
stays finite; the top surface's face normals point up; each slab carries its
region id.

Coverage is asserted by plan-view point-in-triangle rather than by triangle
counts — a count passes on geometry full of holes, which is the one thing this
builder must not have.
