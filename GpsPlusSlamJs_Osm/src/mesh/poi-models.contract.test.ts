/**
 * Every POI model is non-degenerate (W7, closes half of F28).
 *
 * WHY THESE TESTS MATTER, and it is a specific gap rather than a general one.
 * DEC-R4-14 shipped fifty procedural models with **no contact sheet**, accepting
 * in writing that _"a tag that appears at none of the six fixture sites ships
 * without ever having been looked at"_. F28 then recorded the consequence
 * bluntly: _"the fifty POI models were judged by no one."_
 *
 * The gallery page (`gallery.html`) is the half only a person can do. This file
 * is the half a machine can, and the two answer different questions: a human
 * looking at a grid sees "the bench is too tall", while these catch the models a
 * human would never notice because they draw NOTHING — an empty mesh renders as
 * absence, and absence at a site with no such POI is indistinguishable from
 * correct behaviour.
 *
 * The height check is not redundant with the height being DERIVED. It is derived
 * from the mesh, so a model that accidentally built nothing gets a consistent,
 * self-agreeing height of zero — the two-sources-of-truth defect removed, and
 * the wrong answer preserved.
