# `mesh/plates.ts`

## Purpose

Turns OSM ground areas — car parks, pitches, landuse, water — into flat filled
surfaces. The layer the feedback asked for as _"flache Platten quasi im 3D-Raum"_.

## Public API

- `isPlateArea(tags): boolean` — does this feature belong to this builder?
- `buildAreaPlates(features, { frame, groundHeightM?, clipTo? }): AreaPlate[]` —
  one entry per polygon, each with a `MeshData`. Skips everything that does not
  qualify.
  - **`clipTo` is optional but strongly recommended**, and omitting it is how a
    caller opts into an unbounded quadratic. See the complexity note below.

## Invariants & assumptions

- **Two exclusions, both to stop two builders drawing the same thing.**
  `building`/`building:part` belong to `buildings.ts` (a plate over a footprint
  sits inside the extruded volume and z-fights with its floor), and anything with
  `highway` belongs to the road builder. The second is the way-449879297 rule seen
  from the other side: a closed `highway` way is a LineString, so filling it would
  put a blob where a ribbon belongs.
- **Terrain is sampled PER VERTEX**, unlike a building. A building is a rigid box
  and takes one sample at the minimum under its footprint (DEC-R2-19); a plate is
  a surface, so a 30 m car park sampled once would cut into the ground at one end
  and float at the other — exactly the artefact the building change removed.
- **Normals point straight up, and are not computed.** A plate is horizontal by
  construction, so a per-face normal would differ only by the noise in the terrain
  samples — which would make a flat car park look faceted.
- **A degenerate polygon is skipped, never emitted as an empty mesh.** Real OSM
  contains collapsed ways; an empty mesh in the list is a draw call for no pixels
  plus a feature id that appears to have geometry.
- **`forcedEars` is forwarded, not dropped.** It is the triangulator's honesty
  flag, in the same family as `roofIsApproximate`. Swallowing it would make the
  count under-report how much of the real planet is malformed.
- **No `three`.** `Float32Array` out, like every builder here (plan §4.2), which is
  also what lets the whole build run in a Worker and transfer rather than copy.

## Examples

```ts
const plates = buildAreaPlates(features, { frame, groundHeightM });
const merged = mergeMeshes(plates.map((p) => p.mesh)); // one draw call
```

## Complexity — why `clipTo` exists

`triangulate` is ear clipping, which is **O(n²)** in ring size, while an OSM
area's size is unbounded. So an area far larger than the view costs
quadratically to draw geometry that is then off screen.

Measured 2026-07-31 (devbox-win11) on `building-block`, one ordinary Cologne
city block. It contains a 316-member administrative boundary relation — the same
one that made ring stitching quadratic, arriving here through a third path:

- its largest polygon is 25 001 points → `triangulate` **2 657.7 ms**
- a 4 867-point one → 111.8 ms, i.e. points ×5.1 for time ×23.8
- `buildAreaPlates` overall: **3 987 ms → 4.00 ms (−99.9 %)** once clipped to the
  demo's rendered extent (1400 m half-width); `park` and `street-corner` are
  unchanged within noise, having no such relation.
- Plate COUNT drops 14 → 9 on that fixture, because five polygons of the
  boundary relation lie entirely outside the rendered area. That is the clip
  working, not geometry being lost.

Clipping first is the same principle `h3-feature-index` applies before covering,
for the same reason: bound the input, because the algorithm downstream cannot
bound itself.

## Tests

`plates.test.ts` — 15 examples. The classification rules, real triangles, flatness
on level ground, per-vertex draping on a slope, holes preserved, degenerate input
survived, and upward normals.

Two of them exist because the synthetic squares were **not enough**: one runs the
builder over the real captured `park.json` fixture (Volksgarten, 11 plates), and
one checks the plates survive `mergeMeshes`. The demo drew nothing while every
synthetic test passed, which is the general lesson — a builder tested only on
geometry the test author constructed is tested against their own assumptions about
the data.

**Known gap:** the demo's e2e asserts plates are BUILT and counted, not that they
appear as pixels. See `2026-07-29-2354-osm-demo-feedback-round-2-plan.md` §7.

Two more added with the 2026-07-31 clip: one pins that areas inside the box
survive while those entirely outside are dropped, and one is a wall-clock budget
(500 ms against a real cost of ~4 ms, versus 3 987 ms unclipped) so the clip
silently ceasing to apply fails at the gate. The budget is absolute rather than a
ratio, and deliberately does not time the unclipped path — asserting that would
make the test itself take four seconds.

**Two more added after the PR #236 review**, which pointed out that the tests
above assert presence, absence and wall-clock time — all of which pass just as
happily if the clip returned the box rectangle for every feature, i.e. none of
them could tell "the clip worked" from "the clip replaced the geometry":

- **Area equivalence**, measured through the index buffer with a shoelace: a
  plate wholly inside the box is unchanged; a straddling plate keeps exactly
  half; a polygon with a hole keeps its hole. (The first attempt at that helper
  read the vertex buffer as triangle soup and silently measured something else —
  `MeshData` is indexed.)
- **The hole that swallows the box**: `outer ⊇ hole ⊇ bbox` must draw NOTHING.
  It drew a solid 8-triangle plate before the `clipRings` fix, which is the
  concrete failure the equivalence gap was hiding.
