/**
 * OSM features → building volumes, honouring `building:part`.
 *
 * THE ONE IDEA THAT MAKES THIS WORTH BUILDING. Landmark detail in OSM is not a
 * model file and not a landmark database — it is many `building:part` polygons,
 * each with its own `height` and `min_height`, under the Simple 3D Buildings
 * schema. A naive one-polygon extrusion of Cologne Cathedral gives a box; the
 * SAME extruder applied per part, respecting `min_height`, gives something
 * recognisably cathedral-shaped. The detail is free if you honour the schema.
 *
 * THE RULE FOR COMBINING THEM, taken from OSM2World's `Building.java` because
 * it is the most complete implementation of the schema anywhere:
 *
 * - A building's parts are the `building:part` areas geometrically inside its
 *   outline (OSM2World also accepts `type=building` relation members with role
 *   `part`; we support both).
 * - **If a building has parts, the outline itself is NOT extruded** — the parts
 *   replace it. Extruding both is the single most visible S3DB mistake: every
 *   detailed building gets a box drawn through it.
 * - If it has no parts, the outline is its own only part.

 * The measurement says there is no such threshold to find:
 *
 * - **The hazard is not in the corpus.** Heidelberg's defensive castle

 *   `building` tag at all**, so it never becomes a volume under any rule. The
 *   way the design cites as `historic=castle` + `building=university`
 *   (`way/32200575`) is **533 m²** — an ordinary building, not an enclosure.
 * - **A cap would break real buildings.** The largest outlines the parts rule
 *   leaves standing are Cologne's train station at ~14 000 m², a Berlin office
 *   block at ~10 200 m² and Tokyo's Keio department store at ~7 200 m². Any cap
 *   low enough to catch a bailey makes all three walk-through, which is a
 *   louder bug than the one it prevents.
 *
 * `site-building-obstacles.test.ts` pins both facts, so a corpus refresh that
 * introduces a real enclosure fails rather than passes quietly.
 *
 * **A volume that starts above the ground does not obstruct it.** `min_height`
 * is what marks an arch or a canopy as passable underneath, and walking under a
 * gateway is the exact move the demo needs at a castle.

 *
 * ORDER-INDEPENDENCE IS PART OF THE CONTRACT (N3), not a side effect: equal

 * over the result — a full scan of every outline for every part, plus a
 * throwaway array each time, where the `find` it replaced had at least stopped
 * early. Measured on a res-7-scale input (each corpus fixture tiled 7x7, since
 * `buildBuildings` has no distance filter and a whole fetch tile really does go
 * in), total build time:

 *
 * So the naive form was a 2-4x regression, and precomputing each outline's
 * bounding box and area ONCE — then rejecting on the box, and on "cannot beat
 * the best area so far", before running any point-in-polygon test — is 4-7x
 * faster than the code this round started from. Two float comparisons discard
 * the overwhelming majority of (part, outline) pairs on a city tile.

/**
 * The terrain under a BUILDING: where its base sits, and how far the ground rises.
 *
 * SAMPLED AT EVERY OUTER-RING VERTEX, not once at an anchor (DEC-R2-19). One sample
 * was the original behaviour and it is only correct on flat ground: on a slope it
 * leaves the building cut into the hill at one end and floating at the other. That
 * was documented as a known seam and was tolerable while consumers rendered a
 * near-flat 600 m terrain square; once terrain covers a whole city with real relief
 * it goes from rare to routine.
 *
 * TAKES THE WHOLE BUILDING, NOT ONE FOOTPRINT (W5, finding R3-1). Every volume of
 * one building has to share a base, because `min_height` is measured from the
 * building's base rather than from the terrain under one part — so sampling per
 * part displaces the parts of one building relative to each other by the relief
 * between them. On Cologne Cathedral that is metres, and it is what made the spires
 * read as separate low-polygon objects stuck on top of the model.
 *
 * Only the OUTER ring of each footprint is sampled. Inner rings are holes —
 * courtyards — and are by definition inside the outer ring's extent, so they cannot
 * lower the base or raise the rise. Sampling them would cost work and change
 * nothing.
 *
 * `rise` is 0 on flat ground, which is what keeps the common case byte-identical to
 * the previous behaviour.
