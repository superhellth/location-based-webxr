 * where nothing is indexed is an agent walking through a visible wall, and a
 * wall indexed where nothing is drawn is a detour around thin air. Both are
 * bugs a reader would diagnose in the wrong file, so the geometry decision lives
 * here rather than in either of them.
 *
 * **`gates` IS REQUIRED, AND THAT IS THE POINT** (DEC-R12-1). A gap cut in the
 * drawn band but not in the index is an agent detouring through a visible
 * opening; a gap cut in the index but not in the band is an agent walking
 * through a visible wall. Making the argument optional would let one consumer
 * quietly omit it — the exact drift this function exists to prevent — so a
 * caller with no feature list passes {@link NO_GATES} explicitly and says so.
 *
 * **A LIST, because a multipolygon has PARTS.** An earlier version took
 * `polygons[0][0]`: the inner index correctly ignores holes, but the outer one
 * silently discarded `polygons[1..]` — disjoint parts of the same barrier, not
 * holes. One part was indexed and the other was invisible, which is precisely
 * the "a barrier the index simply did not see" failure the multipolygon branch
 * was added to remove. Raised in review on #260.
 *
 * Empty when nothing usable is there — a one-node way and an empty way are both
 * ordinary Overpass output rather than errors.
