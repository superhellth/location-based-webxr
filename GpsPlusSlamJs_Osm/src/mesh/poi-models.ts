/**
 * A procedural low-polygon model for each of the fifty most common POI kinds
 * (W17/W18, DEC-R4-7).
 *
 * THE ASK, AND WHY IT IS FIFTY. _"All diese Dinge, die da in dem Google Doc
 * vorkommen, ich finde, die haben verdient, ihr eigenes kleines prozedurales
 * Low-Polygon 3D-Modell zu bekommen"_ — the sheet has ~700 rows, so the owner
 * chose the fifty most common by the sheet's own `Count` column. The ranking is
 * `poi-ranking.ts`; the shapes are here.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THESE "BESPOKE" RATHER THAN A SHAPE FAMILY. The owner was offered
 * ~12 parametrised primitives covering fifty values and rejected it, because it
 * would make a bench and a park seat the same shape at different sizes. Each
 * entry below is its OWN composition: a picnic table is a slab with two benches
 * beside it, a fuel station is a canopy over a pump, a post box is a rounded
 * pillar. They share primitives the way buildings share an extruder.
 *
 * REAL-WORLD DIMENSIONS ARE THE POINT, not decoration. `POI_HEIGHT_M = 6` used
 * to apply to every marker, so a bench and a hospital entrance were the same 6 m
 * orange cone. Scale is most of what makes a bench read as a bench, and it is
 * per KIND rather than per instance — which is why it is baked into the geometry
 * and the consumer places an instance with a translation alone.
 *
 * COLOURS ARE MUTED ON PURPOSE. The affordance heat ramp owns the loud end of
 * the palette and must stay the loudest thing on screen (R4-14 warns the scene
 * is already close to too colourful). These are material colours — timber,
 * galvanised steel, painted metal, stone — not category codes.

/**
 * Kinds whose orientation is MEANINGFUL, so §4a's per-instance yaw must not
 * touch them (DEC-R6-18).
 *
 * Every entry is a flat ground marking — a painted bay, a playing surface, a
 * pool, a ramp mouth. These read as aligned to something real (a kerb, a
 * street, a building line), so a random spin reads as a defect rather than as
 * variety, in a way that a randomly-facing bench does not.
 *
 * AN OPT-OUT LIST RATHER THAN A PER-MODEL FLAG, and the trade is worth stating
 * because the plan asked for the opposite. A required field on all fifty models
 * would force each author to decide, which is the stronger design — but §4 is
 * about to rewrite thirty-four of those models, so fifty new declarations would
 * be written twice. The guard instead is a test: every kind named here must
 * exist in {@link POI_MODELS}, so a typo fails rather than silently leaving a
 * car park spinning.
 *
 * **A model added later gets rotation by default.** That is the accepted risk of
 * the opt-out form; if a future model is a ground marking, it belongs here.
