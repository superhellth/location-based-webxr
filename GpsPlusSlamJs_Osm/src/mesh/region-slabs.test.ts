/**
 * Merged-region slabs (W14, DEC-R2-11).
 *
 * WHY A HOLE IS THE TEST THAT MATTERS. A region is a flood fill over affordance
 * cells, and a building standing inside a park is a hole in it — that is not an
 * edge case, it is the ordinary shape of the data. A slab that fills its holes
 * covers the very buildings the view exists to show, and it does so in a way that
 * looks deliberate: a solid coloured surface reads as "this whole area scores",
 * which is a confidently wrong claim rather than a visible glitch.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS NO LONGER A WALL. DEC-R2-11 asked for a slab rather than a flat
 * overlay so a region reads as a body at a shallow camera angle. DEC-R7b-7a
 * reversed that in round 8 — a region is an overlay on the ground, not an object
 * standing on it — and the height assertion below is what stops "drop the walls"
 * being read as a pure deletion, which it is not: the wall height was also the
 * top surface's lift.
 *
 * The colour is deliberately NOT this module's business — see the sidecar.
