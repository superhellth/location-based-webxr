/**
 * Ground plates — flat areas that are neither buildings nor roads.
 *
 * WHY THEY EXIST. The feedback: _"Genauso alles an Flächen, die so existieren,
 * sowas wie ich Parkplatzfläche oder sowas, die sind ja auch wirkliche Geometrien.
 * Das finde ich, sollte man auch alles wirklich als echte 3D-Geometrien rendern, so
 * dass da die als flache Platten quasi im 3D-Raum hängen."_ Car parks, pitches,
 * landuse — every polygon the scorer already reads, currently invisible in 3D.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A THIN BUILDER. `toGeometry` already classifies these (including the
 * non-obvious rule that a closed way carrying `highway` is a LineString, not an
 * area) and `triangulate` already turns rings into filled geometry for buildings. So
 * the only new decisions are which features qualify, how holes behave, and how the
 * plate follows terrain — which is what these tests pin.
