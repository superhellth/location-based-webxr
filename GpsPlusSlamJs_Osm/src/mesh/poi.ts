/**
 * POI markers, as placement data (W12).
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR. The demo's core affordance is "click a thing and it tells you
 * what it is", and until now the only clickable thing was an affordance cell — an
 * abstraction over the data rather than an object in it. A POI marker is the
 * first feature a user can point at and be told about directly.
 *
 * NO GEOMETRY HERE, for the same reason as `trees.ts`: markers are numerous and
 * identical up to a transform, so they are what `InstancedMesh` exists for, and
 * emitting placements keeps this package free of `three` (plan §4.2). The
 * consumer decides what a marker looks like.
 *
 * NO PER-TYPE ICONS, deliberately. The testing notes asked to see *that*
 * something is there and be able to ask what it is; they did not ask for a
 * playground pictogram. An icon set is a large amount of art and a taxonomy
 * decision, and it can be added later behind this same placement type.
 *
 * WHAT IT MUST NOT DRAW. Every builder in this package has to answer "who owns
 * this feature", and two of them got it wrong on the first attempt. Trees belong
 * to `trees.ts`; areas belong to `plates.ts` and to W14. So this selects on
 * **node-ness as well as tags** — `amenity=parking` is overwhelmingly a way, and
 * selecting on the tag alone would put a marker in the middle of every car park
 * in the tile.
 *
 * @see poi.ts.md

/**
 * The tag keys that make a node a place worth marking, in PRECEDENCE ORDER.
 *
 * The order is load-bearing, not cosmetic. A node can carry several of these at
 * once (`amenity=cafe` + `tourism=information` is ordinary), and object key order
 * in JS is insertion order — so "the first key on the object" would make the
 * answer depend on how the Overpass JSON happened to be written, and the same
 * node could report different kinds on two runs. Fixing the order here makes it
 * a property of the data rather than of its serialisation.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT "every tagged node". A `barrier=gate` or a routing node is
 * not something a user points at to ask what it is, and marking everything would
 * bury the ones that are.
