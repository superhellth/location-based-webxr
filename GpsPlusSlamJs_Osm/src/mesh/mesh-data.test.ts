/**
 * WHY THESE TESTS MATTER (§4, DEC-R6-11/R6-15). Per-face painting is the
 * capability our primitive vocabulary most lacks — it is how the prototypes get
 * a bench with a different-coloured seat from one box — and it is being added to
 * a builder that every other mesh in the package already runs through.
 *
 * So the risk is not "does painting work". It is **"does adding painting change
 * anything for the meshes that do not use it"**: buildings, roads, plates and
 * region slabs all build through `MeshBuilder` on the hot path, and a colour
 * array allocated for each of them would be pure waste that nothing reports.
 *
 * The other half is the alignment trap. Colours are a THIRD parallel array over
 * the same vertices, and `append` splices two meshes together — so a mesh with
 * colours appended to one without (or the reverse) is exactly where the arrays
 * can silently desynchronise. A misaligned colour buffer does not throw; it
 * paints the wrong faces, which looks like a modelling mistake rather than a
 * buffer bug.

  /**
   * WHY THIS EXISTS (§4, DEC-R6-26). The house style places parts with a full
   * transform — `Parts.push` composes a `Matrix4` from position AND rotation —
   * and 13 of its 52 builders use one. The tilts are structural rather than
   * decorative: an information board that is not tilted is a fence panel, and a
   * viewpoint telescope at 31 degrees becomes a pipe lying on a post.
   *
   * THE RISK IS NOT ROTATION, IT IS THE MESHES THAT DO NOT USE IT. Buildings,
   * roads, plates and slabs all run through this builder, so the identity case
   * must be a genuine no-op — not "close enough after a matrix multiply". A
   * silent 1e-16 drift in every building vertex is the kind of change that
   * shows up as a failing pixel assertion three rounds later.
   *
   * The other half is NORMALS. A rotated part whose normals were not rotated
   * with it is lit as though it were still axis-aligned — the same class of
   * silent wrongness as the winding inversion §4 just fixed, and invisible in
   * every count-based assertion.
