/**
 * Ground plates: the flat areas that are neither buildings nor roads.
 *
 * WHY THEY EXIST. The round-2 feedback asked for them by name — _"Genauso alles an
 * Flächen, die so existieren, sowas wie ich Parkplatzfläche oder sowas … sollte man
 * auch alles wirklich als echte 3D-Geometrien rendern, so dass da die als flache
 * Platten quasi im 3D-Raum hängen."_ Car parks, pitches, landuse, water: every
 * polygon the scorer already reads and the 3D view never drew.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A THIN BUILDER. Almost everything it needs already exists and is tested:
 * `toGeometry` classifies the features (including the deliberately non-canonical rule
 * that a closed way carrying `highway` is a LineString rather than an area — way
 * 449879297, pinned by the C# oracle), and `triangulate` already fills rings with
 * holes for buildings. The only new decisions are which features qualify, and how the
 * surface follows terrain.
 *
 * WHY THE TERRAIN SAMPLING IS PER VERTEX, unlike a building. A building takes ONE
 * sample and sits at the minimum under its footprint (DEC-R2-19), because a building
 * is a rigid box. A plate is a surface: a 30 m car park sampled once would cut into
 * the ground at one end and float at the other, which is the artefact the building
 * change was made to remove. So plates drape.
 *
 * WHY IT DOES NOT DEPEND ON `three`. Same as every other builder here: the package
 * emits `Float32Array` positions and normals plus `Uint32Array` indices and stops
 * (plan §4.2), which is also what lets the whole build run in a Worker and transfer
 * rather than copy.
 *

   * unbounded — so an area far larger than the view costs quadratically for

   * `building-block` fixture, one ordinary Cologne city block: it contains a
   * 316-member administrative boundary relation whose largest polygon is
   * 25 001 points, and triangulating it took **2 657 ms** — while a 4 867-point
   * one took 111.8 ms, i.e. points ×5.1 for time ×23.8. `buildAreaPlates` as a
   * whole cost 2 881 ms against 0.24–0.54 ms on fixtures without such a
   * relation, and it runs on every mesh build.
   *
   * Clipping first is the same principle `h3-feature-index` already applies
   * before covering, and for the same reason: bound the input, because the
   * algorithm downstream cannot bound itself.
   *
   * OPTIONAL, so a caller that genuinely wants unbounded areas still can — but
   * such a caller is accepting the quadratic knowingly.
