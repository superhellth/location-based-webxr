/**
 * The S3DB pipeline: heights, extrusion, roofs, `building:part`, and trees.
 *
 * WHY THESE TESTS MATTER. Mesh bugs do not throw. A building extruded in
 * degrees is sheared, a roof with inverted normals is invisible from outside,
 * an outline drawn as well as its parts puts a box through a cathedral — and
 * every one of those renders something. So the assertions here are geometric
 * facts (bounding boxes in METRES, triangle counts, normal directions) rather
 * than "it produced a mesh".
