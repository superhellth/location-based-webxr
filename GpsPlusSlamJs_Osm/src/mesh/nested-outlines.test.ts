/**
 * NESTED building outlines (R5-7, DEC-R5-2).
 *
 * WHY THESE TESTS MATTER. `buildings.ts` already implements the Simple 3D
 * Buildings rule for the FLAT case — an outline with parts is not extruded,
 * because "every detailed building gets a box drawn through it" is the most
 * visible S3DB mistake there is. It got the NESTED case wrong in a way three
 * rounds of testing reported as a symptom and nobody traced:
 *
 * `assignPartsToOutlines` gave each part to `outlines.find(...)` — the FIRST
 * outline containing it. Cologne Cathedral is `way/4532022` (`building=
 * cathedral`) with `way/645732604` (`building=tower`, "Nordturm", height 157)
 * nested inside it. The cathedral sorts first, so it claimed the Nordturm's own
 * `building:part` volumes, the tower outline was left holding NOTHING, and
 * nothing suppressed it. It drew as a solid 157 m prism through the detailed
 * model — which is the reported screenshot exactly.
 *
 * The asymmetry in the report is the confirming detail: `way/645732603`
 * ("Südturm") carries `man_made=tower` with NO `building` tag, so `isBuilding`
 * is false and it is not extruded at all. One tower boxed, one tower missing,
 * from the same cause — see the follow-up on `man_made` (N4/DEC-R5-13) for the
 * missing half, which is deliberately NOT fixed here.
 *
 * ONE RULE COVERS IT, and finding that out cost a wrong turn worth recording. A
 * second rule — "suppress any outline nested inside a larger outline that owns
 * parts" — was written alongside, on the belief that the tower owned no parts.
 * It owns one: the unnamed `way/207377042`. Measured on the corpus, the second
 * rule suppressed nothing the first had not already suppressed, cost 0.8-4.6 s
 * per build at res-7 scale, and deleted four legitimate buildings. It is gone.
