/**
 * Where a mapped gate opens a barrier (DEC-R12-1, DEC-R12-7).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The eighth testing session reported ways and roads crossing
 * barriers with the barrier drawn straight through, and offered a hypothesis:
 * maybe the OSM way really ends and a new one begins after the path. Reading the
 * code ruled that out — each barrier is drawn from its own geometry and nothing
 * joins one way to another, so two ways with a real gap between them already
 * produce two bands with a real gap between them. Where the demo shows an
 * unbroken barrier across a way, OSM says the barrier is continuous there.
 *
 * SO THE QUESTION IS WHEN WE MAY CUT, AND THE ANSWER IS AS NARROW AS POSSIBLE.
 * Cutting wherever a way crosses was measured and rejected: `retaining_wall` is
 * the largest crossing kind at two of six sites, and a road crossing one in plan
 * is normally running above or below the embankment it holds up. The `layer` tag
 * that would separate those cases is absent at three of six sites. An invented
 * opening lets an agent walk through a wall that is really there, which is the
 * louder failure — so a gap opens ONLY where OSM explicitly maps a gate or an
 * entrance NODE on the barrier's own way.
 *
 * "ON THE WAY" IS EXACT COORDINATE IDENTITY, not node-id membership, and that is
 * a property of the model rather than a compromise: `OsmWay` carries inlined
 * geometry and explicitly no node references, because `out geom` exists to avoid
 * resolving them. It works because Overpass emits the same node's coordinates
 * identically wherever they appear — the same fact `positionsEqual` relies on for
 * ring stitching. An epsilon here would be exactly the "plausible-but-wrong"
 * match that docstring warns against: a gate NEAR a wall it is not part of.
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS, MEASURED: over the eight-site corpus this cuts 12 of Cologne's
 * 60 solid barriers, 8 of Heidelberg's 53, 12 of Sylt's 65, 10 of Westminster's
 * 73, 2 of Tower Bridge's 9, 1 of Manhattan's 41 — and NOTHING at Berlin or
 * Tokyo, which map no gate on any barrier at all. Paths will still meet unbroken
 * walls in places; the rule fails towards a solid barrier, which reads as OSM
 * tagging rather than as a pathfinding defect.
 *
 * AND ONE NARROW EXTENSION, DEC-A2: a gate node BESIDE a barrier opens it when a
 * routable, surface-level way through that node also crosses it. The Tower of
 * London is the case — the gate ("Groups Entrance to the Tower") sits 0.17 m off
 * the curtain wall and belongs to the footways, not to the wall, so the exact
 * rule above could never fire and the agent could not walk through the gateway.
 * The conjunction is what keeps this from being the proximity match rejected
 * above: each half alone is a rule this file already refuses.
 *
 * ITS MEASURED COST IS ZERO — it changes no barrier at any of the eight sites,
 * and getting there took two corrections that only the per-site counts exposed:
 * a below-surface gate node opened a Cologne retaining wall, and at Sylt one
 * `barrier=wall` corroborated another. Both were false positives. A rule that is
 * a no-op everywhere looks exactly like a rule that works, so the demonstration
 * is `agent-route.tower-gate.test.ts` on real Tower geometry, not the corpus.

 *
 * - **`highway=pedestrian` + `area=yes`** — the building-outline argument
 *   arriving from the other side. A plaza is an OUTLINE, not a line through, and
 *   plazas abut walls constantly. **`isRoad` handles this one.**
 * - `highway=construction` / `proposed` — a route that does not exist yet
 *   vouching for a gate. **`isRoad` does NOT handle this**, and an earlier
 *   version of this comment claimed it did:
 *   `roads.ts` filters nodes, a missing `highway`, `tunnel=yes`, `covered=yes`
 *   and `area=yes`, and nothing else. **The class is real, and BOTH values are
 *   evidenced in the corpus**: `highway=construction` appears **3×** in Berlin's
 *   fixture and **1×** in Westminster's; `highway=proposed` appears **2×** in
 *   Westminster's. **Pinned per value by `site-barriers.test.ts`**, so neither a
 *   fixture refresh nor a swap of one value for the other can falsify this
 *   sentence silently. Hence {@link UNBUILT_HIGHWAYS} below.
 *
 *   **Pinned per value, not as a total**, because a summed assertion once let
 *   a wrong split (3 construction / none proposed) sit green: a count pinned
 *   more coarsely than the claim it defends is not a pin.
 *
 * The filter lives HERE rather than in `isRoad` on purpose: `isRoad` also
 * decides what `buildRoads` DRAWS, and whether a road under construction should
 * be drawn is a separate question from whether it may vouch for a gate. Widening
 * that predicate to settle this one would be a rendering change smuggled into a
 * pathfinding fix.
 *
 * `roads.ts` otherwise already encodes "a `highway` that is genuinely a linear
 * route" and is what the demo draws ribbons from — so reusing it keeps "a route
 * passes through here" meaning the same thing in both places rather than in two
 * that can drift.
 *
 * **AND IT MUST BE ON THE WALKING SURFACE**, by the same argument that vetoes a
 * below-surface gate NODE: a road passing under a wall is not a way through it.
 * Without this the veto was asymmetric — the node was checked and the
 * corroborating way was not. `isRoad` already refuses `tunnel=yes` and
 * `covered=yes`; `isBelowSurface` additionally catches `layer`/`level` below
 * zero and `location=underground`, so both run.
