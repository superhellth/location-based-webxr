/**
 * The column model — `(cell, heightM)` adjacency.
 *
 * Why these tests matter:
 * The navigation design names this its **highest-risk assumption** and says it
 * "should be tested before anything is built on it". The reason is concrete: an
 * agent on top of the Tower wall and an agent at its foot occupy the SAME H3
 * cell, so a 2D reachability pass cannot tell them apart and a naive merge lets
 * them path to each other. These tests pin the rule that makes them distinct.
 *
 * The design's own test case is here verbatim — two states in one cell column
 * 8 m apart, asserted non-adjacent. The other half of that case (that a path
 * routes to the gate instead of over the wall) needs the pass-A graph and
 * lives with it.
 *
 * @see column.ts.md

/**
 * Terrain slope — the half of the rule that was specified and never built.

 * Why these tests matter:
 * The step threshold was chosen against DISCONTINUITIES (a kerb, a stair riser,
 * a wall). In production the heights it compares are DEM samples at cell
 * centres ~6.4–6.9 m apart, so as a single absolute limit it made any ground
 * steeper than ~7.5 % impassable — and the demo reported the Cologne
 * Frankenwerft promenade as unreachable in every downhill direction while the
 * `walkable` heat map rated it highly. Every pre-existing fixture is FLAT, so
 * nothing here could see it.
 *
 * These pin the decomposition: the height ABOVE THE GROUND is a step, the
 * ground itself is a slope, and the two get different limits.
