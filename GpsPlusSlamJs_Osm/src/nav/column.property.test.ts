/**
 * Column-model property tests.
 *
 * Why these tests matter:
 * The unit tests pin the design's stated cases — the wall, the lawn beside it,
 * the boundary. These prove the algebra holds for arbitrary heights and
 * arbitrary cells, and they exist because the column rule is about to become
 * the edge relation of a graph. A pathfinder is entitled to assume its edges
 * are symmetric and that widening the climb limit never REMOVES an edge; both
 * are properties no single example can establish.
