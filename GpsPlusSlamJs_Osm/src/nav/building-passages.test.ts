/**
 * `building-passages.ts` — a road that goes THROUGH a building.
 *
 * Why this test matters:
 * The eighth testing session asked for an archway where a way crosses a
 * building, and the code had one rule for it — S3DB `min_height > 0` — which
 * does not fire for the commonest case: a road through a gate tower with no
 * height tagging. `tunnel=building_passage` is the tag mappers actually use, and
 * DEC-R12-3 adopted it.
 *
 * The load-bearing assertion is the SCOPE. DEC-R12-3's wording offered two
 * readings — "the same passable-underneath treatment `min_height` gets" (the
 * whole volume stops obstructing) and "passable ALONG it" (a corridor). Measured
 * over the corpus, the first reading makes 30-35 % of the built AREA at Cologne,
 * Tokyo and Tower Bridge walk-through, and 22 % of the buildings at Tower Bridge
 * — an agent strolling through a city block because one arcade was mapped. That
 * is the same failure DEC-R12-1 refused for barriers, so the corridor reading is
 * the one implemented and the tests below pin it: the passage opens, and the
 * rest of the same building stays solid.
 *
