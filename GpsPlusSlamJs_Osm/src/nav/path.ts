 * Pass A — reachability and pathfinding over H3 cells.

 * `connectedComponents` answers "are these two cells in the same blob". An
 * agent needs the other question — "how do I get from here to there" — and the
 * navigation design names traversal within a component as the piece that does
 * not exist yet.
 *
 * **This is now a thin wrapper over {@link findStatePath}.** The search itself
 * is generic over a state, because review on #257 showed that a cell-keyed
 * search cannot express the column model: one slot per cell means the wall foot
 * and the wall top cannot coexist, and a predicate handed only cell strings has
 * to resolve one height per cell — a 2D model with a step filter. For a genuine
 * `(cell, heightM)` search use `columnSpace` from `column-space.ts`; this
 * module is the flat case, where one state per cell is the whole truth.
 *
 * That flat case is not vestigial — it is the design's rung 5.3, where agents
 * wander over free `gridDisk` adjacency and "will walk up the Tower walls, and
 * that is the point".
