/**
 * Searches over an arbitrary state space: breadth-first, and A\*.
 *
 * `findStatePath` is shortest in STEPS; `findCheapestPath` is cheapest under a
 * caller-supplied cost (DEC-R13-1). Everything below about states, keys and the
 * `candidates`/`canEnter` split is shared by both.
 *
 * **Why this is not just "pathfinding over cells".** The first version of pass A
 * keyed its visited set by H3 cell, and review on #257 showed what that costs:
 * a cell could be entered at most once, so the wall-foot state and the wall-top
 * state could not both exist in one search — and the step predicate, seeing only
 * cell strings, had to resolve one height per cell. That is a 2D model with a
 * step filter, which is exactly what the column model exists to replace.
 *
 * So the state is whatever the caller says it is, and the caller supplies its
 * identity. `Column` is a state whose key includes a height; a bare cell is a
 * state whose key is itself. Nothing here knows which.
 *
 * **`candidates` and `canEnter` are separate on purpose.** Generating a
 * neighbour is cheap — grid adjacency — while deciding whether the step is legal
 * is not: pass B does point-in-polygon and a height lookup per call. Splitting
 * them lets the search drop an already-visited state BEFORE paying for the
 * decision, which in a flood is roughly five calls in six.
