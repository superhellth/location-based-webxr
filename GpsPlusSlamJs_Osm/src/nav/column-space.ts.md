# `column-space.ts` — the column model as a searchable state space

**Purpose.** Turn `(cell, heightM)` states into something
[`search.ts`](./search.ts.md) can walk.

## Why this exists

This is the piece that was missing when review on #257 found that pass A
"collapses the column model back to 2D". The collapse had **two** causes, and
both have to be answered or the model is still flat:

- **One state per cell.** A cell-keyed visited set holds the wall foot or the
  wall top, never both. `columnKey` puts the height in the key.
- **One height per cell.** A predicate handed only cell strings must resolve a
  single height. `levelsAt` returns **every standable height** in a cell, so the
  two states are generated in the first place.

The second is the substantive one, and it is easy to miss: keying by height
without a source that can report more than one height per cell still produces a
single-valued field — just with a longer key.

## Public API

- `columnSpace({ levelsAt, stepThresholdM? }) => StateSpace<Column>`
- `columnKey(column) => string`

### `levelsAt(cell) => readonly number[]`

Every height at which an agent can stand in that cell.

- **More than one is the point.** A cell containing a wall has the ground beside
  it and the walkway on top; a cell with a footbridge over a road has two.
- **Empty means not standable at all** — inside a building, or off the scored
  working set — and no state is generated for it.
- Returning exactly one everywhere reduces this to the 2D model, which is a
  legitimate configuration (a terrain-only pass B) but not the column model.

## Invariants

- **The cell itself is among its own candidates.** Stepping between two levels
  of one cell — up onto a wall where it is low enough — is a legal move that
  exists _only_ in a column model. The search drops the state's own key, so
  standing still is never generated.
- **Candidates are sorted.** `gridDisk` promises no ordering, and a route that
  depended on it would vary with the H3 version — the same reason
  `connectedComponents` sorts.
- **`canEnter` is `columnsAdjacent`**, so every rule in
  [`column.ts.md`](./column.ts.md) applies unchanged, including the non-finite
  height guard.

## Height quantisation

`columnKey` rounds to **3 decimal places**, because floats are not identities.
Heights arrive from a DEM interpolation, so two samples of one physical surface
can differ in the last bits — and two states that are the same place must
produce the same key, or the search revisits the same ground indefinitely. A
millimetre is three orders of magnitude below `STEP_THRESHOLD_M`, so nothing the
threshold can distinguish is lost.

## Example

```ts
const space = columnSpace({
  levelsAt: (cell) =>
    isWall(cell) ? [groundOf(cell), wallTopOf(cell)] : [groundOf(cell)],
});
const route = findStatePath(agent, (s) => s.cell === target, space);
```

## Tests

`column-space.test.ts` — key separation and quantisation; that the wall foot and
the wall top **coexist as states** (the case the old composition could not
express); the same-cell climb refused at 8 m and allowed at 0.3 m; empty
`levelsAt`; and the design's end-to-end case — a route that reaches the gate and
never enters a wall cell.

**The control matters as much as the case.** Raising the step threshold above
the wall height makes the same fixture route _over_ the wall and produces a
shorter path. Without it, the detour would not be evidence of the height clause
— it would just be what the fixture always does.

**What these do NOT cover:** where the levels come from. Deriving them from
building volumes, barriers and the DEM is pass B's job.
