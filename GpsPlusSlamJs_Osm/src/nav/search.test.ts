/**
 * The weighted search (DEC-R13-1).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS NOW. `search.ts` was covered only through its two users —
 * `path.test.ts` for the flat cell space and `column-space.test.ts` for columns —
 * and its own sidecar said what that left out: "weighted edges, because there are
 * none. If a space ever wants them this module is the wrong starting point."
 * DEC-R13-1 is that space. The ninth testing session found the NPC taking
 * neither the shortest route nor the walkable one, and the single line of code
 * behind both halves was that `findStatePath` is breadth-first: every edge costs
 * 1, so a straight run and a staircase of the same step count are
 * indistinguishable and the winner is decided by `gridDisk` ordering.
 *
 * `findCheapestPath` is the answer, and the properties worth pinning are the
 * ones that make it an answer rather than a second search: it returns the
 * CHEAPEST path (not merely a cheap one), it respects `canEnter` exactly as the
 * BFS does, and it refuses the inputs that would silently make it wrong — a
 * negative edge, a non-finite cost, an overestimating heuristic.
