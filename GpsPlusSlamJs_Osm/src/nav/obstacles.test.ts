/**
 * The obstacle index — what blocks an agent, and at what height.
 *
 * Why these tests matter:
 * This is pass B's half of the navigation design, and the design flags one
 * hazard about it specifically and twice: **the index must not be keyed in
 * ENU**, because `BuildingVolume.footprint` lives in a frame rebuilt on every
 * publish, so every recentre invalidates every coordinate in it. That hazard
 * has now appeared three times on this branch in different guises.
 *
 * Building the index from `OsmFeature` geometry — which is lat/lng, from
 * Overpass `out geom` — makes it structural rather than something to remember:
 * an ENU coordinate cannot enter, because none is ever in scope.
 *
 * The other thing pinned here is the pairing with `levelsAt`. An obstacle that
 * only ever *removes* levels would make a walled cell unstandable, and an agent
 * cannot walk beside a wall it is standing inside — so the ground level is
 * always offered alongside the wall top.
 *
 * **NOTHING HERE BLOCKS ANYTHING YET.** `Obstacle.rings` is built and stored,
 * but no code in this slice asks `containsPoint` about it: `obstacleLevelsAt`
 * only ADDS a level. Wired into `columnSpace` as it stands, an agent gets the
 * wall top as an extra state and the ground beneath the wall stays fully
 * traversable. An earlier draft of this comment claimed the footprint was
 * blocked, which review on #259 correctly called out as describing behaviour
 * that does not exist. The footprint test is the next slice.
 *
 * @see obstacles.ts.md
