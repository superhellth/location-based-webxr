/**
 * The obstacle index — what blocks an agent, and at what height.
 *
 * Why these tests matter:
 * This is pass B's half of the navigation design, and the design flags one
 * hazard about it specifically and twice: **the index must not be keyed in
 * ENU**, because `BuildingVolume.footprint` lives in a frame rebuilt on every
 * publish, so every recentre invalidates every coordinate in it. That hazard
 * has now appeared three times on this branch in different guises.
 *
 * Building the index from `OsmFeature` geometry — which is lat/lng, from
 * Overpass `out geom` — makes it structural rather than something to remember:
 * an ENU coordinate cannot enter, because none is ever in scope.
 *
 * The other thing pinned here is the pairing with `levelsAt`. An obstacle that
 * only ever *removes* levels would make a walled cell unstandable, and an agent
 * cannot walk beside a wall it is standing inside — so the ground level is
 * always offered alongside the wall top.
 *
 * **THINGS BLOCK NOW, and the last section is where.** This header used to say
 * the opposite, correctly: `obstacleLevelsAt` only ADDS a level, so an agent
 * got the wall top as an extra state and walked along the ground straight
 * through the wall. `crossesObstacle` is the slice that header named, and the
 * shape of the fix is worth keeping — **blocking had to become a property of
 * the STEP rather than of the cell.** At res-13 a cell is ~8 m across and a
 * wall ~0.5 m thick, so a wall contains a cell's centre about one time in
 * sixteen; any rule of the form "you may not stand in a walled cell" is
 * transparent to pathfinding the other fifteen.

    // An earlier review argued `blockedDespitePassages` had a live defect: it
    // decided "is this step inside the obstacle" with
    // `rings.some(ring => contains(a) && contains(b))` — inside ANY ring —
    // where `building-passages.ts`'s `insideFootprint` uses ring PARITY and
    // documents why (*"it moved Tokyo's count from 6 to 7 buildings"*). Under
    // `some`, a step in a courtyard is "inside the outer ring", so a pierced
    // building refuses it and **the courtyard is unwalkable**.
    //
    // This test was written to check that argument and concluded "THAT DOES NOT
    // REPRODUCE". **It was wrong, and the reason is the fixture, not the
    // reasoning** — see the rebuild note below. Once the courtyard cells are
    // placed clear of the passage corridor the step IS blocked, exactly as
    // argued. The predicate is now shared with `building-passages.ts` as
    // `insideRingsByParity`, so there is one rule instead of two.
    //
    // **NOT A WATER PROBLEM, and an earlier version of this comment said it
    // was.** `passages` is set in exactly one place — inside `addBuildings` —
    // so `blockedDespitePassages`, the only caller of `insideRingsByParity`
    // here, is unreachable for water and for barriers. `addWater` also emits
    // one thin quad per bank segment rather than rings with holes, so a
    // Thames relation's islands arrive as bands and never as inner rings.
    // Both halves of the old claim were false.
    //
    // The forward hazard is the opposite one and is worth stating: those
    // per-segment quads OVERLAP at every joint, so if anything ever attaches
    // `passages` to a banded obstacle, parity will read an overlap as OUTSIDE
    // where `.some()` read it as inside.
