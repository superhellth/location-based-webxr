/**
 * The column model as a searchable state space.
 *
 * This is the piece that was missing when review on #257 found that pass A
 * "collapses the column model back to 2D". The collapse had two causes and both
 * are answered here:
 *
 * - **One state per cell.** A cell-keyed visited set can hold the wall foot or
 *   the wall top, never both. {@link columnKey} puts the height in the key.
 * - **One height per cell.** A predicate handed only cell strings must resolve a
 *   single height, which is a heightfield, not a column. {@link ColumnSpaceOptions.levelsAt}
 *   returns **every standable height** in a cell, so the two states are
 *   generated in the first place.
 *
 * The second is the substantive one. Keying by height without a source that can
 * report more than one height per cell would still produce a single-valued
 * field — just with a longer key.
 *
 * @see column-space.ts.md
