/**
 * Roads that go THROUGH a building, and where they open it (DEC-R12-3).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The eighth testing session asked for an archway where a way
 * crosses a building. The code already had a rule for that — S3DB
 * `min_height > 0`, plus `building=roof` for canopies — and neither fires for
 * the case actually reported: a road through a gate tower with no height
 * tagging. `tunnel=building_passage` is what mappers write for it, and it turns
 * out to be everywhere: 118 such ways in the Tokyo extract, 18 at Westminster,
 * 16 at Cologne, and at least one at every site in the corpus.
 *
 * **THIS IS A PROPERTY OF THE ROAD, NOT OF THE BUILDING**, which is why it lives
 * in its own module and why the obstacle index consults a second feature set for
 * the first time. `min_height` and `building=roof` are both readable from the
 * building alone; this one is not.
 *
 * **A CORRIDOR, NOT THE WHOLE VOLUME, and that is a measurement rather than a
 * preference.** DEC-R12-3 was written as "the same passable-underneath treatment
 * `min_height > 0` and `building=roof` already get", which excludes the entire
 * volume from the obstacle index. Measured over the eight-site corpus, that
 * reading makes **30-35 % of the built AREA** at Cologne, Tokyo and Tower Bridge
 * walk-through, and 22 % of the BUILDINGS at Tower Bridge — an agent strolling
 * through a whole city block because one arcade was mapped. That is the same
 * failure DEC-R12-1 refused for barriers ("an invented opening lets an agent walk
 * through a wall that is really there"), so the decision's other phrase — passable
 * **along it** — is the one implemented.
 *
 * WHY A LINE RATHER THAN A HOLE IN THE RING. The obstacle index tests a step
 * against a closed RING (`segmentCrossesRing` joins the last vertex to the first
 * whether or not the caller repeated it), so a hole cannot be expressed by
 * cutting the ring the way `barrier-gates.ts` cuts a barrier centreline.
 * Buildings do not need it to be: they are drawn from their own footprints and
 * their passability has always been an INDEX-ONLY property here — `min_height`
 * and `building=roof` volumes are drawn exactly as they were and simply do not
 * obstruct.
 *
 * WHY A LINE RATHER THAN THE TWO MOUTHS, which is the same question one layer
 * down and was got wrong first. Opening the crossing POINTS admits the entry
 * step and nothing else — and nothing else is needed to free the entire
 * interior, because `segmentCrossesRing` is false for a segment lying wholly
 * inside a ring and `obstacleLevelsAt` never removes a cell's ground level.
 * Before an opening existed that was unobservable: a closed footprint could not
 * be entered, so interior freedom cost nothing. The first version of this rule
 * made it reachable, and a route could then cut a diagonal between two mouths
 * through the rooms between them — the corridor claim above, false by
 * construction. Carrying the LINE lets `crossesObstacle` ask "is this step on
 * the passage" of the inside as well as of the boundary.

 * **LINES, NOT THE TWO MOUTHS, and the difference is the whole corridor claim.**
 * An earlier version returned the boundary crossing points and the index
 * admitted any step passing near one. Blocking is a pure BOUNDARY property here
 * — `segmentCrossesRing` is false for a segment lying wholly inside a ring — so
 * that opened the mouths and, with them, the entire interior: every subsequent
 * step between two interior cells crossed no ring at all, and a route could cut
 * a diagonal between two mouths through the rooms between them. Carrying the
 * line lets the index ask "is this step ON the passage" for the inside as well
 * as for the boundary, which is what makes the corridor a corridor.
 *
 * **A passage that merely ENDS inside the footprint counts.** OSM ways are
 * routinely split at a building outline, which leaves the tagged segment wholly
 * inside and crossing the ring zero times. Raised in review as a hypothesis and
 * then MEASURED: no passage in the corpus has both endpoints inside a solid
 * footprint, but Tokyo has one with a vertex inside a building whose ring it
 * never crosses — so the containment test finds a seventh building there that
 * the crossing test alone missed. One real case out of eight sites, and its
 * failure mode is silent: the building simply stays solid.
