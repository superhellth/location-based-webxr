# `geo-event.ts`

**Purpose:** the pure half of the `GeoEvent` port — deterministic timed spawn
points on the heat map (§6, DEC-R6-14). Ported from
`GpsPlusSlamCs/Algorithms/GeoEvent.cs`.

## Public API

- `nextEventTime(now, { overlapMinutes })` — the next quarter-hour boundary.
  - `overlapMinutes` defaults to **5** and is applied BEFORE the rounding, so
    asking at exactly 10:15 returns **10:30**, not 10:15. The "an exact boundary
    maps to itself" property holds only at `overlapMinutes: 0`.
  - The overlap models "I am arriving now, do not send me to a spawn that is
    about to move". A user PICKING a time is not arriving, so a picker must pass
    `overlapMinutes: 0` or it will show a slot 15–20 minutes after the one that
    was asked for.
- `eventCandidates({ bbox, globalSeed, eventTime, count })` — seeded positions.
- `climbToLocalMaximum({ start, heatAt, neighbours, steps })` — `{ cell, left,
heat }`.
- `bestPickForTile({ bbox, globalSeed, eventTime, toCell, toLatLng, heatAt,
neighbours, steps, threshold?, batches? })` — the best position in one tile,
  or `undefined`.
  - `toLatLng` inverts `toCell`; it is what lets a pick report WHERE THE EVENT
    IS rather than the seed the climb started from.
  - `threshold` is the per-cell bar, from the rule table's `__threshold__` for
    the category. Defaults to the multiplicative identity.
- `newGeoEventFor({ user, tiles, ... })` — `{ eventTime, picks, tilesSearched }`,
  one pick per tile that had a valid position, NEAREST TO THE USER FIRST.
  - `tilesSearched` is how many tiles were LOOKED AT, which is not
    `picks.length`: a tile that is all water is searched and yields nothing.
    Under DEC-R9-15 two devices can search different numbers, so the UI needs
    this to say "you have less loaded" rather than looking broken.
- `QUARTER_HOUR_MS`.

Everything takes its inputs injected — no H3, no affordance index, no knowledge
of how far the heat reaches. That is what makes all of it testable in CI, and
what let it be written before the wide-heat work exists.

## Invariants & assumptions

- **Determinism is the feature.** Same seed and time give the same positions,
  forever. The seed is quantised to MINUTES exactly as the C# does — without
  that, a client whose clock is a second out computes a different position,
  which is the same failure as no determinism at all and much harder to notice.
- **Latitude and longitude are drawn from separately salted hashes.** One hash
  for both would lay every candidate on a diagonal.
- **`left: true` means "no answer", not "a weak answer".** A climb that stops
  where its own neighbourhood reaches unscored ground may simply have run out of
  map. An unfetched cell scores as the _identity_ — a plausible low number — so
  treating "no data" as "cold" places every event on the rim of whatever was
  loaded, with nothing reporting it (DEC-R6-14f).
- **Unscored neighbours are skipped during the climb, not fatal.** The first
  version abandoned on any unscored neighbour, which sounds cautious and is
  useless: the scored field is finite, so any climb near its boundary gave up
  immediately.
- **The climb compares NEIGHBOURHOOD heat**, as `GetHeatForTilePlusNeighbours`
  does — it walks towards a broad warm area rather than an isolated spike.
- **It is bounded by `steps`**, because it runs in the worker and an
  ever-rising field would otherwise walk until the process died.

## Deliberate divergences from the C#

- **Determinism is within TypeScript only** (DEC-R6-14e). The C# seeds
  `new Random((int)(globalSeed + nr + unixMinutes))` — .NET's subtractive
  generator, not reproducible in JS without porting a runtime's internals, and
  changed by .NET between versions. Positions will **not** match the C#.
- **The `heat > 9` quality gate IS ported, translated** (round 9, DEC-R9-3). An
  earlier note here said it was not, on the grounds that "the C# heat map summed
  counts where this one multiplies rule factors". **That is wrong**:
  `HeatMapTile.Heat` is documented _"Starts at 1 as the neutral multiplication
  identity element"_ and accumulates with `Heat *= elemHeat` — the same product
  over the same rule table. So `> 9` is not a tuned number: it is 9 cells x an
  identity of 1, i.e. "strictly above an entirely baseline neighbourhood".

  The rule is now `heat > neighbours(cell).length * threshold`, derived rather
  than hard-coded — correct at H3's twelve pentagons too, where a cell has five
  neighbours. TWO CORRECTIONS LANDED 2026-08-05 and this paragraph used to state
  the pre-correction version:
  - **It said `> 7` while the code computed `neighbours().length + 1` = 8.**
    `gridDisk(cell, 1)` returns seven cells INCLUDING the centre and the sum is
    over exactly those seven, so the `+ 1` — written as though `neighbours()`
    excluded self — made the gate ~14 % stricter than this file claimed. Code
    and docstring disagreed for a round.
  - **The identity was hard-coded.** `threshold` now comes from the rule table's
    `__threshold__`, the same constant the MAP uses to call a cell usable
    ground. The shipped table declares none, so both are 1 and the two used to
    agree by coincidence rather than by construction.

  The corpus measurement showing ~45–51 % of ground passing is what a
  deliberately permissive gate does; rejecting unmapped and vetoed ground is its
  job, and finding the good spot is the climb's.

  **The gate assumes a SELF-INCLUSIVE `neighbours()`, and nothing enforces it.**
  `climbToLocalMaximum` sums `heatAt(cell)` plus each `around` while skipping
  `around === cell`, so it tolerates either convention — n cells for a
  self-inclusive one, n + 1 for a self-exclusive one — while the gate divides by
  `neighbours().length` as though the first were guaranteed. Correct for
  `gridDisk`; off by one cell for any injected `neighbours()` that excludes
  self, which is exactly what the old `+ 1` was written for.

## Known limit

Hill-climbing cannot cross flat ground. A field of mostly-identical scores gives
it nothing to follow, and the measured corpus distribution has a large mass at
and below the identity — so the quality of the spawn choice depends on the heat
map having broad gradients, which is worth checking on real data before relying
on it.

## Which tiles the caller offers

`newGeoEventFor` takes the tile list rather than deriving it, and that is a
deliberate divergence. The C# always uses the centre tile plus its three nearest
neighbours; under DEC-R9-4 fetch-on-demand that could mean four Overpass fetches
and minutes of waiting. The worker starts with the CENTRE tile alone — whose data
is already loaded, because the user is standing in it — and can widen later
without touching this function.

A tile with no valid position is SKIPPED. The C# throws for the centre tile and
logs a warning for a neighbour; a tile that is all water genuinely has no event,
and an exception would take the other tiles down with it.

## `candidate` vs `position` — the distinction to get right

A `BestPick` carries **two** coordinates and they are not interchangeable:

- `candidate` — the raw seeded point the climb STARTED from. The C# names this
  `RawStartEventPos`. It is kept only so a caller can draw what the climb did.
- `position` — the centre of `cell`, where the climb SETTLED. **This is where
  the event is**, and it is the C#'s
  `geohasher.ToLatLong(bestPick.ExactGeoHash)` (`GeoEvent.cs:87`).

Anything user-facing — a marker, a distance, a direction — must read
`position`. Both defects this caused have been fixed and are pinned by tests:
the demo's map drew its winner marker at `candidate` while its tooltip quoted
`cell`'s heat, and `newGeoEventFor` ordered picks by `candidate` where the C#
orders by the settled position (`GeoEvent.cs:107`), so "nearest event" could
name the wrong tile.

`position` is REPORTED rather than left for each caller to derive from `cell`,
because two callers deriving it separately is exactly how they drifted apart.
`toLatLng` is injected alongside `toCell`, keeping the module free of H3.

## Tests

`geo-event.test.ts` — the four quarter-hour branches, determinism across seed,
time and minute-quantisation, candidate spread and containment, and the climb's
uphill / flat / bounded / left-the-field behaviours.

For `newGeoEventFor` it also pins ordering by the SETTLED position (mutating
the sort key back to `candidate` fails exactly that test) and the longitude
cosine at 51° N, where the correction flips the order. Note that the ordering
tests use a position-PRESERVING `toCell`/`toLatLng` pair: an earlier
`toCell: () => "0,0"` collapsed every tile onto one cell, which was invisible
while the sort key was `candidate` and made the sort a no-op the moment it
became `position`. A constant `toCell` cannot test ordering at all.
