/**
 * Deterministic timed spawn points on the heat map — the `GeoEvent` port
 * (§6, DEC-R6-14).
 *
 * WHAT THE C# DOES, from `GpsPlusSlamCs/Algorithms/GeoEvent.cs`. Seed a handful
 * of candidate positions inside a tile from `globalSeed + candidateNumber +
 * eventTimeInMinutes`, climb the heat map from each towards a local maximum,
 * gate on quality, and return the best pick per tile ordered by distance to the
 * user. Positions rotate every quarter hour and are identical for everyone who
 * shares the seed, so clients agree on where the event is without coordinating.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS AND IS NOT. It is the PURE half: the time arithmetic, the
 * seeded candidates and the hill-climb, each over injected inputs. It does not
 * know about H3, about the affordance index, or about how far the heat reaches.
 * That is deliberate — it makes every rule above testable in CI, and it means
 * the module does not have to wait for the wide-heat work to be finished before
 * it can be written and checked.
 *
 * THREE DELIBERATE DIVERGENCES FROM THE C#, each recorded because a later reader
 * comparing the two files will otherwise assume a mistake:
 *
 * - **Determinism is within TypeScript only** (DEC-R6-14e). The C# seeds
 *   `new Random((int)(globalSeed + nr + unixMinutes))`, which is .NET's
 *   subtractive generator — not reproducible in JS without porting a runtime's
 *   internals, and .NET has changed it between versions. Same seed and time give
 *   the same positions here, forever; they will NOT match the C#.
 * - **The heat lookup may answer "no data"**, and that is not the same as low
 *   heat. See {@link climbToLocalMaximum}.
 * - **The `heat > 9` quality gate IS ported, TRANSLATED rather than copied**
 *   (DEC-R9-3, round 9). An earlier version of this header said it was not
 *   ported, on the grounds that the C# "summed counts" where this package
 *   multiplies rule factors. THAT WAS WRONG: `HeatMapTile.Heat` starts at 1 as
 *   the multiplication identity and accumulates with `Heat *= elemHeat` — the
 *   same product over the same kind of rule table. So `> 9` is 9 cells at
 *   identity, i.e. structural rather than field-tuned, and the faithful form is
 *   `heat > neighbours(cell).length * threshold`. Derived from `neighbours()`
 *   rather than written down, which also keeps it correct at H3`s twelve
 *   pentagons.
 *   - It read `.length + 1` until 2026-08-05, which was an off-by-one:
 *     `gridDisk(cell, 1)` returns seven cells INCLUDING the centre and the sum
 *     is over exactly those seven, so the `+ 1` -- which assumed `neighbours()`
 *     excluded self -- made the gate ~14 %% stricter than this paragraph claims.
 *   - `threshold` is the rule table`s per-category `__threshold__`, i.e. the same
 *     constant the MAP uses to call ground usable, rather than a hardcoded
 *     identity. Both default to 1, so they used to agree by coincidence.
