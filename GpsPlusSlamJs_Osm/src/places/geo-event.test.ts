/**
 * The `GeoEvent` port — deterministic timed spawn points on the heat map
 * (§6, DEC-R6-14).
 *
 * WHAT IS BEING PORTED. `GpsPlusSlamCs/Algorithms/GeoEvent.cs` decides where an
 * event happens: seed candidate positions inside a tile from
 * `globalSeed + candidateNumber + eventTimeInMinutes`, climb the heat map from
 * each towards a local maximum, gate on quality, and return the best pick.
 *
 * WHY THESE TESTS MATTER, and it is mostly not about the arithmetic.
 *
 * **Determinism is the whole feature.** The seeding exists so every client
 * agrees where the event is without coordinating. A value that varied per call
 * would put two players in different places while both believed they were right
 * — the worst kind of failure, because nothing looks broken.
 *
 * **The hill-climb walking off the edge of scored ground is the trap the plan
 * names** (DEC-R6-14f), and it fails SILENTLY: an unfetched cell scores as the
 * identity, a perfectly plausible low number, so a climb that treated "no data"
 * as "low heat" would settle on the rim of the scored disk every time and
 * nothing would report it.
 *
 * **The quarter-hour boundary has four branches**, and an off-by-one in any of
 * them shifts every event by fifteen minutes.

 * WHY THESE TESTS MATTER — the gate is the C# constant TRANSLATED, and the

 *
 * DEC-R9-3 ports `heat > 9` by replacing the 9 with the neighbourhood's actual
 * cell count, because the C#'s 9 IS "nine cells at the multiplicative identity".
 * `bestPickForTile`'s own docstring says so: *"H3 gives 7 cells rather than 9, so
 * the identical rule is `> 7`"*.
 *
 * The code computed `neighbours(cell).length + 1`. `gridDisk(cell, 1)` returns
 * SEVEN cells INCLUDING the centre, so that is 8 — while `climbToLocalMaximum`
 * sums exactly those 7. The `+ 1` assumed `neighbours()` excluded self. The gate
 * was ~14 % stricter than the rule it claims to be.
 *
 * And the identity was hardcoded. The rule table can declare a per-category
 * `__threshold__`, which is what the MAP uses to decide whether a cell is usable
 * ground; the shipped table declares none, so both are 1 today and the two agree
 * by coincidence rather than by construction. Two definitions of "usable ground"
 * that happen to match is the same shape as the three definitions of "below the
