/**
 * The corpus of places the demo is tested at — ONE table, two consumers.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (DEC-R4-1, DEC-R4-2, DEC-R4-11). For three rounds the demo was
 * looked at in exactly one spot, and that is the condition that produced the
 * round-3 cathedral finding: an item shipped a fix for a defect that was not the
 * reported one, because nothing could reproduce the reported one. The answer is
 * a small set of places chosen for **what makes them awkward**, not for coverage.
 *
 * WHY ONE TABLE RATHER THAN TWO. The offline fixture suite needs a place to
 * capture an extract for; the demo's location picker needs a place to offer a
 * human. Those were nearly built as two lists — and two lists drift, so the
 * places you can *see* stop being the places that are *tested*, which is exactly
 * the blind spot this corpus exists to remove. One table, and the picker and the
 * capture script both read it.
 *
 * WHY THE `reason` FIELD IS NOT DECORATION. "Why is this place in the corpus" is
 * the first thing lost and the hardest to recover: a later reader looking at six
 * coordinates cannot tell whether a site may be swapped for a prettier one. The
 * `trait` makes that machine-checkable, the `reason` makes it human-readable, and
 * `sites.test.ts` asserts both.
 *
 * THIS TABLE IS NOT A LIST OF NICE VIEWS. Several entries are deliberately
 * unphotogenic. A site earns its place by being hard to render correctly.
 *
