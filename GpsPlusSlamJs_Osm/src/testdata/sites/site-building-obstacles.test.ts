/**
 * WHY THESE TESTS MATTER — they are the record of a decision that the data
 * overturned.
 *
 * DEC-R11-9 chose "`building:part` volumes where they exist, else the outline
 * **below a footprint-area cap**", to stop a castle-sized outline sealing its
 * own courtyard, and it deliberately left the cap's value to be **measured
 * against this corpus rather than guessed**. The measurement says there is no
 * cap to find, and both halves of that are pinned below so a corpus refresh
 * re-opens the question instead of quietly inheriting the answer:
 *
 * 1. **The hazard is not in the corpus.** Heidelberg's defensive castle carries
 *    no `building` tag at all, so it never becomes a volume under any rule. The
 *    way the design cites as the trap — `historic=castle` also tagged
 *    `building=university` — is a few hundred square metres: an ordinary
 *    building, not an enclosure.
 * 2. **A cap would break real buildings.** The outlines that survive the parts
 *    rule at the top of the size range are a train station, a city-block office
 *    and a department store, all in the 7 000–17 000 m² range. Any cap low
 *    enough to catch a bailey makes all of them walk-through, which is a louder
 *    bug than the one it prevents.
 *
