/**
 * WHY THIS TEST MATTERS. The bridge-deck follow-up
 * (`GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-08-08-2344-osm-bridge-deck-drawn-at-ground-level-followup.md`)
 * measured how many `layer > 0` roads the demo draws flat on the ground, and how
 * many of them cross something — then used those numbers to size three design
 * options for the owner.
 *
 * That measurement had two problems, both raised in review on PR #592, and this
 * file exists to fix them:
 *
 * 1. **It counted crossings against BARRIERS ONLY**, while the option it was
 *    sizing ("lift to clear whatever it crosses") is defined over *"every road
 *    against every barrier **and building**"*. The doc then leaned on the
 *    barrier-only figure to conclude that option "leaves the general defect
 *    untouched" — a conclusion that flips if decks cross buildings in bulk, and
 *    Tokyo's elevated walkways are exactly where one would expect that.
 * 2. **It had no reproduction path** — no test, script, or definition of
 *    "crosses in plan". A measurement steering a design decision should be
 *    re-runnable, and a fixture refresh should be able to falsify it.
 *
 * The counts are therefore PINNED here rather than written in prose. They are
 * expected to move when fixtures are re-captured; when they do, read the change
 * and update the doc, do not silently re-baseline.
 *
 * "Crosses in plan" = the deck's polyline intersects a barrier centreline or a
 * building footprint ring, using the same `segmentsIntersect` the gate rule and
 * the navigation obstacle index use. Touching counts, consistent with that
 * helper's documented bias.
