/**
 * WHY THESE TESTS MATTER. The navigation design's sharpest finding is that
 * **nothing in the pipeline represented a curtain wall**, so pass B could not
 * see the Tower's wall any more than pass A could. DEC-R7b-14 and DEC-R11-2
 * answered that with a barrier builder whose output is DRAWN — and the whole
 * claim is about real OSM tagging, not about hand-built fixtures. Synthetic
 * ways prove the extrusion arithmetic; only the corpus proves the SELECTOR
 * matches what mappers actually write.
 *
 * That distinction earned its keep immediately. The first implementation keyed
 * the solid set on `barrier=*` alone, which is what the owner decision named
 * (DEC-R11-2/R11-4) — and every one of the four `historic=citywalls` ways in
 * the Cologne extract carries **no `barrier` tag at all**. The single most
 * on-point piece of geometry in the corpus was invisible to a feature built to
 * see it, and no unit test over invented ways could have noticed.
 *
 * These are coarse PROPERTIES for the same reason `site-geometry.test.ts` gives:
 * a property survives a fixture refresh and a palette change, a pixel does not.

/**
 * Everything one site needs, built once.

 * **AT MODULE LEVEL, INCLUDING THE OBSTACLE INDEX.** `buildObstacleIndex` runs
 * `coverCells` at res-13 (~8 m) for every quad of every barrier in a whole
 * city extract, which is seconds of work — building it inside an `it` put two
 * sites past vitest's 5 s per-test timeout when the suite ran in parallel,
 * while passing comfortably when the file ran alone. That is the same reason
 * `site-geometry.test.ts` hoists its volumes, and the failure mode it avoids is
 * the nastier one: a timeout that only appears under load reads as flake.
