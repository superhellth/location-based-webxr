/**
 * WHAT `buildObstacleIndex` COSTS, measured rather than guessed (DEC-G7).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Stage 4 had to decide WHERE the index is built.
 * DEC-R11-16 chose "in the worker, once per publish, in the same pass as the mesh
 * builders" and explicitly left the publish-path cost to be measured before
 * wiring (stage-3 follow-ups §4). This is that measurement, and it decided the
 * question in favour of DEC-R11-19: the index is built **lazily, on the first
 * route request**, because the sweep is hundreds of milliseconds per publish on
 * a corpus extract and a session where nobody orders a route would pay all of it
 * for nothing.
 *
 * **The figures, on the developer machine, 2026-08-08** — the whole corpus was
 * measured once while taking this decision, and every site landed in the same
 * band:
 *
 * - `cologne-cathedral` — 2 347 covered cells, 186 obstacles, 1 281 features
 * - `heidelberg-altstadt` — 2 280 / 433 / 1 135
 * - `berlin-alexanderplatz` — 2 394 / 56 / 1 298
 * - `sylt-westerland` — 2 294 / 189 / 729
 * - `manhattan-midtown` — 2 716 / 227 / 1 463
 * - `tokyo-shinjuku` — 1 937 / 173 / 1 749
 *
 * Six sites cost ~2.4 s wall clock including the JSON parse, i.e. a few hundred
 * milliseconds each. The extracts are res-9/res-10 captures; **the demo's
 * working set is a res-7 fetch tile and is substantially larger**, so this is a
 * floor on the real publish cost rather than an estimate of it.
 *
 * **ONLY ONE SITE IS MEASURED HERE, and that is deliberate.** Sweeping all six
 * cost the package's unit stage ~15 s — a 37 % increase for a measurement whose
 * conclusion every site agreed on — and even two sites put measurable
 * module-level load on a pool where `poi-models.test.ts` runs with under two
 * seconds of headroom against the 5 s per-test cap. `site-barriers.test.ts` and
 * `site-building-obstacles.test.ts` already build an index at every site, so the
 * corpus-wide "it indexes something everywhere" floor is covered there; this
 * file keeps the one that carries the argument — Cologne, the site the demo
 * opens on, and the home of the ~16 200 m² canopy the passability rule exists
 * for. The other five figures are in the list above, from the one-off sweep.
 *
 * **WHY THE ASSERTIONS ARE CELL COUNTS AND NOT DURATIONS.** `coverCells` at
 * res-13 (~8 m) over every barrier and every solid building is the work, and the
 * number of covered cells is a DETERMINISTIC proxy for it — same input, same
 * number, on any machine under any suite load. A wall-clock threshold would be a
 * flake on CI and a false green on a fast laptop, which is the failure mode
 * `site-barriers.test.ts`'s own header describes.
 *
 * A change to these counts is a selector change or a resolution change. Both
 * move the publish cost, so both should fail here and be re-argued rather than
 * absorbed.
 *
