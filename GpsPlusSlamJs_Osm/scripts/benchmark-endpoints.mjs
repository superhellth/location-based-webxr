/**
 * Times the public Overpass instances on one identical res-7 tile.
 *
 * Run on demand only — it hits donated public infrastructure:
 *
 *   node scripts/benchmark-endpoints.mjs
 *   node scripts/benchmark-endpoints.mjs --lat 50.9413 --lng 6.9583
 *   node scripts/benchmark-endpoints.mjs --res 8 --host lz4   # one host, one res
 *   node scripts/benchmark-endpoints.mjs --matrix              # W1's full sweep
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A TEST, same rule as `capture-fixtures.mjs`: a
 * test that touches the network is a test that fails when a public server is
 * down, and this one additionally puts ~21 MB and tens of seconds of server CPU on a
 * volunteer-run instance — and in `--matrix` mode ~1.2–3.4 GB and ~25–70 minutes
 * of it. It must never run in a gate.
 *
 * ONE QUERY PER HOST, SERIALISED, ONE PASS — in the DEFAULT mode. That is an
 * ethical constraint, not a technical one: these instances' usage policies
 * explicitly ask callers not to generate this load. The statistical consequence
 * is real and must survive into the results doc: **a single sample cannot
 * support "host A is faster than host B"**. It supports weaker claims that are
 * still worth having — reachable or not, answers this query form or 504s on it,
 * same order of magnitude or an order out.
 *
 * `--matrix` DELIBERATELY BREAKS THE "ONE PASS" HALF OF THAT RULE, and only with
 * the owner's explicit authorisation (DEC-R5-10, taken twice against a stated
 * cost). What it does NOT relax is the RATE: the volume is spread across a
 * per-OPERATOR cooldown, backoff on refusal, a give-up after two refusals and a
 * hard runtime budget. Every one of those rules lives in `benchmark-matrix.mjs`
 * and is unit-tested, because a politeness rule that is only a comment is not a
 * rule. **Six URLs are three operators** — see that file for the byte-identical
 * responses that prove it.
 *
 * FIRST BYTE IS REPORTED SEPARATELY FROM LAST BYTE on purpose. Overpass spends
 * most of a large query executing server-side before it streams anything, so
 * the two numbers separate a slow query planner from a slow pipe — different
 * problems with different remedies.
 *
 * The narrative plan and results live in the docs repo
 * (`GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-07-28-2336-overpass-endpoint-benchmark-plan.md`
 * and its `-results.md` sibling). Only the machine-readable JSON stays here,
 * next to the script that writes it.

 * Matches `FETCH_RES` in `src/spatial/resolutions.ts`.

 * Overridable with `--res`. **And the answer that override produced is the
 * opposite of the obvious one**, so it is recorded here: shrinking the bbox
 * barely shrinks the payload. Measured on `lz4`, 2026-07-29, same centre.
 *
 * **SUPERSEDED as a property of the production query, though not as a
 * measurement** — the three figures below are the `nwr` form, retired by F32 on
 * 2026-08-03. Under areal-only the payload tracks area again (res 7 → res 9 is
 * 21x, not 1.8x), so what follows explains a behaviour this app no longer
 * exhibits. Kept because the sweep still runs all three forms, and the contrast
 * is the point of running them.
 *
 * Under the previous `nwr` form, then:
 *
 * - res 7 (4.55 km² hexagon) — 68.0 MB
 * - res 8 (0.65 km²) — 42.7 MB
 * - res 9 (0.093 km²) — 38.7 MB
 *
 * **49x less ground for 1.8x less data.** The cause is `out geom`, which prints
 * the FULL geometry of every element that INTERSECTS the bbox — the OSM wiki is
 * explicit that "constituent ways or relations may extend beyond these bounds".
 * A handful of city-scale ways (rivers, landuse multipolygons, boundaries,
 * power lines) dominate the bytes, and every bbox in Cologne intersects them
 * whatever its size.
 *
 * So `FETCH_RES` is NOT the lever on payload it looks like. The lever the wiki
 * points at is `out geom(south,west,north,east)`, which emits only coordinates
 * inside the box — see the results doc for why that is not a drop-in change.
