/**
 * The decision logic of the Overpass matrix sweep (W1, DEC-R5-1/DEC-R5-10).
 *
 * WHY THESE TESTS MATTER, and they are not the usual reason. Everything here
 * governs how hard this project hits **donated public infrastructure**. The
 * sweep the owner authorised moves ~1.2–3.4 GB across six URLs, and the whole
 * justification for running it at all is that it is spaced politely. A
 * politeness rule that exists only as a comment is not a rule — it is an
 * intention that the next refactor silently deletes.
 *
 * The specific bug these exist to make impossible: **the six URLs are three
 * operators, and the evidence is in this repo.** In `docs/overpass-endpoint-
 * benchmark.json`, `lz4.overpass-api.de` and `z.overpass-api.de` returned
 * byte-identical 67 973 393-byte bodies, and `overpass.private.coffee` and
 * `overpass.kumi.systems` returned byte-identical 66 348 574-byte bodies. A
 * cooldown keyed on the HOSTNAME therefore puts three times the intended rate on
 * FOSSGIS while reporting itself as polite — which is exactly the behaviour the
 * usage policies ask callers not to have, dressed as compliance.
 *
