/**
 * Captures real Overpass responses as checked-in test fixtures.
 *
 * Run on demand only — it hits donated public infrastructure:
 *
 *   pnpm run capture:fixtures            # the four everyday fixtures
 *   pnpm run capture:fixtures beach      # one, by slug
 *   pnpm run capture:sites               # the six corpus sites (W2/DEC-R4-2)
 *   pnpm run capture:sites tokyo-shinjuku
 *
 * Each capture writes a JSON file containing the raw payload plus the
 * provenance the plan requires (bbox, query, capture date, the exact command to
 * regenerate) and the S3DB census that gates the plan's §8.
 *
 * Deliberately a plain `.mjs` script rather than a test: fixtures are captured
 * a handful of times in the package's life, and a test that touches the network
 * is a test that fails when a public server is down.
 *
 * TWO CORPORA, ONE SCRIPT, and that is the point rather than convenience. The
 * six-site corpus (W2) needed the same bbox arithmetic, the same key filter and
 * the same union query as the four everyday fixtures, and a second script would
 * have been a THIRD copy of the key list — which is precisely the duplication
 * `src/source/capture-script-query.test.ts` exists to catch, and precisely the
 * mistake that cost this project a day. So the spec grew a `res` and an
 * `outDir` and the query path stayed single.
 *
 * THE SITE LIST IS IMPORTED, NOT COPIED. `src/places/sites.ts` is the one table
 * the demo's picker and this script both read (DEC-R4-11); duplicating six
 * coordinates here would rebuild the drift that table exists to prevent. Node
 * strips the types at import (`--experimental-strip-types`, hence the flag in
 * the `capture:sites` script), so this needs no build step and cannot read a
 * stale `dist` — the failure mode the key-list test rejects `dist` imports for.

/**
 * Fixtures are captured at res 10, NOT at the `FETCH_RES` (res-7) fetch
 * resolution — and the original reason for that is WITHDRAWN.
 *
 * The 2026-07-28 morning session concluded that public instances were saturated
 * and full-size tiles uncapturable. That was an artefact of the key REGEX this
 * script used to build; a union of exact-key statements over the same 32 keys
 * returns a whole res-7 tile (21,847 elements, 28.31 MB) in 18.2 s. See
 * `GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-07-28-1040-overpass-remeasurement-findings.md`.
 *
 * So a full-size capture is possible. What stops it now is repo weight: a res-7
 * tile is ~28 MB and the merge tests want a second overlapping one, against a
 * corpus that is 4.8 MB today. That decision is open (plan §10).
 *
 * These four stay the everyday corpus regardless: small, fast in CI, and REAL
 * OSM data with real tag distributions and real multipolygons, which is what
