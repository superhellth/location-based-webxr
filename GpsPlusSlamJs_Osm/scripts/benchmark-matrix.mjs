/**
 * The decision logic of the Overpass matrix sweep — pure, and therefore tested.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE FILE FROM THE RUNNER. Everything here decides how hard
 * this project hits **donated public infrastructure**, and the sweep the owner
 * authorised (DEC-R5-10) moves ~1.2–3.4 GB across six URLs. The justification
 * for running it at all is that it is spaced politely — so the spacing has to be
 * an assertion rather than a comment. `benchmark-endpoints.mjs` does the I/O and
 * cannot be unit-tested; this file holds every rule that governs the load and
 * `benchmark-matrix.test.mjs` pins all of them.
 *
 * WHY IT IS `.mjs` AND NOT TYPESCRIPT, like `capture-fixtures.mjs`: it must run
 * under plain `node` with no build step, and a script that imports the package's
 * `.js` specifiers does not resolve under Node's type stripping (F23 records the
 * same constraint for the capture script). The cost is that its tests are
 * `.test.mjs`, which `config/vitest.config.ts` reaches for explicitly.
 *
 * THE ONE NON-OBVIOUS RULE, and the reason this file exists at all: **six URLs
 * are three operators.** `docs/overpass-endpoint-benchmark.json` shows
 * `lz4.overpass-api.de` and `z.overpass-api.de` returning byte-identical
 * 67 973 393-byte bodies, and `overpass.private.coffee` and
 * `overpass.kumi.systems` returning byte-identical 66 348 574-byte bodies. A
 * cooldown keyed on the hostname puts three times the intended rate on FOSSGIS
 * while reporting itself as polite.

/**
 * The three forms the sweep is a matrix over, in DEFINITION order.

 * - `clipped` — `out geom(bbox)`, which the 2026-07-28 results doc names as the
 *   highest-value lever: it prints only coordinates inside the box, which is
 *   what would remove the giant-relation tail.
 * - `areal-only` — the server-side analogue of what `capture-fixtures.mjs` does
 *   client-side. NOT "no relations": multipolygon and boundary relations are the
 *   ones this package actually renders, so dropping them would measure a query
 *   nobody would ship.
