// Single source of truth for every package's test gate: stage order,
// canonical commands, and which JSON reporter (if any) provides exact test
// counts. This is the multi-package replacement for the library pilot's
// stages.mjs — one ProjectConfig per workspace package (plus one for the
// workspace root chain). Both shells (timed-stage.mjs, run-gate.mjs) resolve
// their project from the invoking cwd, and chain-guard.mjs cross-checks each
// project against its package.json chain scripts on every gate run.
//
// Commands run through a shell (`&&` is allowed) with the package's and the
// workspace root's node_modules/.bin on PATH, exactly like the previous
// inline package.json scripts. They live here rather than inline in
// package.json for the same reasons as the pilot (see stages.mjs upstream):
// compound commands survive, and "any forwarded arg ⇒ filtered run" stays
// trivially detectable.
//
// knip caveat (same as the pilot): binaries that now appear only here
// (jscpd, dpdm, depcruise, stylelint, …) are invisible to knip's
// package.json-script analysis; affected devDependencies need
// ignoreDependencies entries in the root knip.json.

    //    framework to SOURCE via tsconfig `paths`. Nothing maps
    //    `gps-plus-slam-osm`, so `tsc` cannot see one of its types until dist
    //    exists — and until this stage was added, nothing in the workspace
    //    built it at all, which is what broke the /osm/ deployment.
    // 2. It needs `build:framework` FIRST TOO, since 2026-08-15. It used to
    //    have no such stage at all — see the retracted paragraph below — and
    //    that made the gate's correctness depend on a side effect of the e2e
    //    stage. `tsc` and `vitest` here resolve `gps-plus-slam-app-framework`
    //    through the package `exports` -> dist (this package declares NO
    //    tsconfig `paths`; only RecorderApp does), so the same argument that
    //    puts `build:osm` first puts this first.
    //
    //    RETRACTED, and kept because the reasoning reads plausible: "It has no
    //    `build:framework` stage, because `pnpm run dev` — the
    //    Playwright webServer command — already runs `build:deps`, whose cost
    //    lands inside the `test:e2e` row rather than a row of its own. Since
    //    2026-08-09 that build goes through the same staleness check as the
    //    stage above, so the webServer no longer rebuilds what the gate just
    //    built — it was costing ~3.5 s per e2e package, in six of them."
    //
    //    It is true that the webServer builds it. What it misses is that the
    //    build was then reachable ONLY through a stage that DEC-G2 removes,
    //    and that the other five consumers keep their own build — so a
    //    dependent run would have type-checked OsmDemo against whichever
    //    framework dist a sibling package happened to leave on disk.
    //
    // Otherwise it now runs the SAME stage set as every other demo app. It
    // previously ran only typecheck/test:unit/test:e2e — no format, lint,

        // The suite did NOT grow: 74 tests before and after, +0. What grew is the
        // work the app does per refresh. DEC-K1 took `SCORE_DISK_MAX_RADIUS` from
        // 4 to 6 on a field request, so every refresh now scores 127 chunks where
        // it scored 61, and the e2e suite drives real refreshes end to end.

        // MEASURED, two clean runs with nothing else on the machine:
        // **806.6 s immediately before the change, then 1011.9 s and 1020.8 s
        // after** — +26 %, reproducible, all 74 passing throughout. A third,
        // contended run in the same window read 1090.7 s, which is why the two
        // quiet samples are the ones quoted.
        //
        // 1300 s is ~1016 s + 28 %, keeping the same loose-alarm shape the 900
        // had against its own median. It is NOT a licence to grow into: the next
        // reader should read the two numbers above as the price of two rings and
        // ask whether a third is worth another quarter.
        //        // LOCAL RUNS ONLY, since 2026-08-10: this is a same-machine median plus
        // 30 %, and CI records no median of its own, so enforcing it there
        // measured the runner and failed two all-green PRs. See the CI note in
