// Why this test matters: three consecutive full-cascade runs were lost on
// 2026-08-20 because several gate runs were executing against the SAME working
// tree at once. Two of them failed on wall-clock budgets they only missed
// because they were competing for CPU, and the third failed with
// `Cannot find package 'gps-plus-slam-app-framework/state'` — one run was
// rewriting the framework's `dist/` while another imported from it. Every one
// of those tests passes in isolation, so each failure read as a flaky test and
// invited a threshold change in a package nobody had touched. That is the
// expensive part: the wrong diagnosis was cheaper to act on than the right one.
//
// The lock makes the real cause say its own name. It is deliberately NOT a
// mutex that queues — it refuses, loudly, naming the run that already owns the
// tree, because two cascades wanting the same tree is a mistake to see rather
// than a wait to schedule.
