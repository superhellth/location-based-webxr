  // parallel workers each drive a full WebGL scene, so they queue on one GPU

  // THE MEASUREMENT BEHIND DEC-N8 WAS TAKEN ON THE WAYFINDING SUITE, not here:
  // serial, its seven tests finished in 26.6 s with one dropping 39.6 s ->
  // 907 ms. The reasoning transfers (same GPU, same contention), the numbers do
  // not — an earlier version of this comment was pasted verbatim into three
  // configs and claimed "all seven specs" in each, which is true of none of
  // them. Found in review of PR #336.
  // Measured on THIS suite (5 spec files, 7 tests).
  // workers therefore buy latency and flakes, not throughput. The sibling
  // Landing and OsmDemo suites reached the same setting from their own
  // measurements — see their configs for the numbers.
