// Repo-meta test: a test file that measures a clock AND asserts a number must
// be a deliberate, justified choice — not something that arrives by habit.
//
// Why this test matters. On 2026-08-20 four packages failed their gates on
// timing in one day. Most of it was concurrency between gate runs (fixed by
// `scripts/test-timing/gate-lock.mjs`), but not all: `terrarium.test.ts` failed
// again at 95 ms against an 85 ms bound on a verifiably idle machine, because
// vitest spreads ~130 files across worker threads and a 60 ms platform timer
// lands 30-40 ms late however quiet the machine is.
//
// The expensive part was never the flake. It was that each failure invited
// "widen the threshold" — a one-line change — while the real answer required
// looking outside the failing test. `agent-route.test.ts` shows where that
// leads: its bound was raised 2000 -> 3000 ms because it was failing one run in
// three IN ISOLATION, and the widening is recorded in the file as a fix.
//
// WHAT THIS GUARD IS NOT. It does not ban clocks in tests, and it does not
// judge whether a bound is well-sized — a human does that when adding the
// allowlist entry. It enforces exactly one thing: that the set is enumerated,
// so the next addition is a reviewed decision rather than a habit, and so the
// list can be worked down deliberately.
//
