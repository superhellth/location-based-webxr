// Repo-meta test: retracted res-7 payload figures do not reappear as live claims.
//
// Why this test matters: the same defect has now landed three times, and each
// time it was found by a human reading rather than by any gate.
//
//  1. 2026-08-09 — `21,847 elements` was withdrawn as a res-7 feature count
//     (`resolutions.ts` FETCH_RES, N2/W2), and four sites in committed source
//     went on quoting it. Fixed 2026-08-11 (funnel plan §2.2).
//  2. 2026-08-03 — the areal-only query shipped as F32 at **21.1 MB** per res-7
//     tile, and `resolutions.ts` went on saying **~68 MB / 23–110 s** while
//     additionally describing areal-only as an unadopted investigation. Nine
//     more sites repeated the derived "28–68 MB".
//  3. 2026-08-11 — a fresh plan (the click-path stage-timing plan) built its
//     whole cold-cache prior on the 68 MB figure, because a stale production
//     doc comment was the most quotable source for it.
//
// **A number is not retracted until nothing quotes it as current.** Retraction
// notes are cheap to write and invisible to every existing gate: nothing
// type-checks a comment, and a wrong number in a JSDoc block is the input to
// the next plan, which is exactly how (3) happened. This test is the gate that
// could have caught all three.
//
// What it does NOT do: judge whether a number is right. It only enforces that
// the specific figures this repo has formally retracted appear near an explicit
// retraction marker, so a reader meeting one cannot mistake it for current.
// Introducing a NEW wrong number is still invisible here, and no automated
// check can fix that.

/**
 * Language that marks a figure as history rather than as a current claim.
 *
 * Two families, and both are needed:
 *
 * - **Retraction** — the figure is formally dead (`retracted`, `withdrawn`,
 *   `superseded`, `corrected from`, `used to say/quote` — but NOT the bare
 *   `used to be`, which is ordinary English about anything at all).
 * - **Contrast** — the figure is alive as the OTHER side of a comparison, which
 *   is how the F32 change is documented everywhere it is explained: "21.1 MB
 *   against the previous `nwr` form's 68.0 MB" is not a stale claim, it is the
 *   measurement that retired one.
 *
 * **Deliberately narrow within each family.** The first version accepted "no
 * longer", "stale" and "was wrong", and that was a bug rather than generosity:
 * `demo-pipeline.ts:554` then read "28–68 MB" two lines under "that no longer
 * works", a sentence about a code path and not about the number beside it. (It
 * reads `~21 MB` now — the sweep that this test gated fixed it. The example is
 * kept as history, in the past tense, because a test about false statements in
 * comments must not contain one.) A marker set made of ordinary English
 * rehabilitates by coincidence, which is indistinguishable from not having the
 * gate at all.
 *
 * **`instead of` was here and has been removed**, for the second instance of
 * exactly the bug above: it is the commonest two-word contrast phrase in
 * English, it says nothing about the number beside it, and "the mesh is built
 * in the worker instead of on the main thread" three lines from a reintroduced
 * `~68 MB` would have rehabilitated it silently. It was holding up exactly one
 * legitimate site, which now says `against the previous nwr form` like its
 * neighbours. A marker must name the form or the retraction, never merely
 * contrast two things.
