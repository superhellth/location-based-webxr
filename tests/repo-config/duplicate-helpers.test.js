// Repo-meta test: a canonical helper is not re-implemented under its own name.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `check:dup` already runs jscpd on every commit, and it
// cannot see any of what this guards: it is invoked per package, so it compares
// a package only against ITSELF, and its floor is 50 tokens, which every helper
// below is far under. That is not a misconfiguration — it is a reasonable
// default nobody revisited as the workspace grew to twelve packages — but it
// means the repo had a copy-paste detector and four toasts, five `clamp01`s and
// four `smoothstep`s at the same time.
//
// THE RULE IT ENFORCES (owner decision DEC-H3, 2026-08-24): shared BEHAVIOUR is
// unified across packages; a pure one-liner may exist once per package. So the
// guard has two shapes, `shared` and `perPackage`, and which one a name gets is
// the decision, not an implementation detail.
//
// WHAT IT CANNOT DO. Stated in full, because a guard whose limits are unwritten
// gets read as covering everything. A review found most of these by trying to
// construct violations that slip past — which is the right way to read a
// source-text guard, and the right way to extend this list.
//
//  - **It is blind to the same helper under a different name.** The `el(id)`
//    family exists as `el`, `requireEl` and `getRequiredElement`; a fourth
//    `smoothstep` was found by a human reviewer as an inline, unnamed
//    expression in `terrain-slope.ts`. A name-keyed guard finds neither.
//  - **It only guards names someone listed.** It cannot find the NEXT
//    duplicated helper, only re-duplication of a known one. That is the trade
//    accepted when the cross-package detector (which could find new ones, at an
//    unmeasured noise cost) was deliberately not adopted.
//  - **It sees ONE workspace root.** `git ls-files` runs at the webxr repo
//    root, so `c:\gps\gps-plus-slam\GpsPlusSlamJs` — the core library, and the
//    largest single body of code the rule covers — is invisible to it. Making
//    it cross-root would mean a test in one repository reading another by
//    hardcoded sibling path, which is the coupling the pnpm-override rule
//    exists to keep out of CI. The rule still applies there; this guard does
//    not enforce it.
//  - **It sees `<pkg>/src/**.ts` only.** A copy in `scripts/`, `config/`, at a
//    package root, or in a `.js`/`.mjs`/`.tsx` file is out of scope.
//  - **A class method or object-literal shorthand is not matched.**
//    `class Util { clamp01(v) {} }` reads as a member, and matching that shape
//    would collide with every ordinary method name.
//
// It is still worth having: every entry below is a unification that was paid
// for once, and this is what stops it being undone by the next session that
// does not know the helper exists.
//
