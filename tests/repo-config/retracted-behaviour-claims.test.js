// Repo-meta test: behaviour this repo has REMOVED is not still described as current.
//
// Why this test matters: `retracted-osm-figures.test.js` guards retracted
// *numbers*. This is the same defect class for retracted *behaviour*, and it
// has now happened once, expensively:
//
//   2026-06-06 — `createGpsAnchor`'s **large-jump bypass** (an on-screen snap
//   that overrode the frustum gate on a >2°/4 m/20 m alignment delta) was
//   removed, because once the whole frame rides one lerped `arWorldGroup`
//   matrix a large jump is already absorbed smoothly for the entire view, so a
//   per-anchor on-screen snap only manufactured a visible hard jump. The
//   removal is recorded in `gps-anchor.ts.md`. THREE README sites went on
//   describing the bypass as live for over two months — including the public
//   front page of the repo.
//
//   Found 2026-08-20, and not by a gate: by a fact-check of marketing drafts
//   that had faithfully paraphrased the stale README into claims that were the
//   exact inverse of the shipped code. A wrong sentence in a README is the
//   input to everything downstream — the next plan, the next article, the next
//   developer's mental model — which is precisely how a doc bug becomes a
//   public credibility problem.
//
// What it does NOT do: judge whether a description is right. It enforces only
// that specific, formally-removed behaviours are not stated as current. A NEW
// wrong description is still invisible here, and no automated check fixes that.
