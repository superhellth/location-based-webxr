/**
 * Pure playback "transport" model — the single source of truth for which clip
 * is active, whether it is playing or paused, and where the playhead is.
 *
 * One reducer drives three things at once: the exclusive one-clip-at-a-time
 * policy (a `click` makes that id the only active clip), the play/stop button
 * (`toggle`), and the seekable progress bar (`seek` + `tick` + `progressFraction`).
 * Keeping it one model — rather than a per-sprite flag plus a separate
 * "who's playing" map — is what removes the chance of the two drifting and what
 * lets us ignore a *stale* `ended` (an event from a clip the user already
 * switched away from) instead of letting it stop the new clip.
 *
 * Framework-free and view-free: no Three.js, no DOM, no audio element. The view
 * layer maps these actions to `HTMLAudioElement` calls and forwards `tick` /
 * `ended` back in. Reused by component 8's AR scene.
