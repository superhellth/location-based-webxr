/**
 * Why these tests matter: this reducer is the single source of truth for "what
 * is playing, where, and is the panel open" — it drives both the exclusive
 * one-clip-at-a-time policy and the progress bar. The subtle cases are (a) a
 * click always (re)starts from 0, (b) `seek` is fraction-of-duration and
 * clamped, and (c) a *stale* `ended` (from a clip the user already switched
 * away from) must be ignored, or it would wrongly stop the newly-started clip.
