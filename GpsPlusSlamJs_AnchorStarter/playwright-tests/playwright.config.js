/**
 * Playwright configuration for the persistent-anchor starter example.
 *
 * Scope (Tier 0, see GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-06-01-anchor-starter-e2e-test-plan.md):
 * - The page loads without console errors.
 * - The static start/intro UI renders.
 * - The E1 capability gate fires honestly in a desktop browser that lacks
 *   WebXR (Playwright Chromium has no `navigator.xr`), instead of crashing.
 *
 * Chromium-only because WebXR is Chrome-focused. The dev server runs on the
 * starter's dedicated port 5181 so it can coexist with the minimal example
 * (5180) and the recorder (5173). Clipboard permissions are granted up front
 * so the Tier 1 copy-link tests (a later plan tier) can read/write the
 * clipboard without re-prompting.
