# AnchorStarter e2e tests

Playwright end-to-end tests for the persistent-anchor starter example.

## Running

```bash
pnpm run test:e2e          # build framework + run the suite (Chromium)
pnpm run test:e2e:headed   # same, with a visible browser
pnpm run test:e2e:ui       # Playwright UI mode for debugging
```

`pnpm test` runs the full gate (`test:core` then `test:e2e`).

> Always use the pnpm scripts — never call `playwright` directly (repo rule).
> The scripts build the framework `dist/` first so Vite serves a fresh build.

## Scope

**Tier 0 + Tier 1** are both implemented. **Tier 0** (`smoke.spec.js`) is the
smoke + E1 capability gate, which needs no browser-API mocking because Playwright
Chromium genuinely lacks WebXR. **Tier 1** (`placement-flow.spec.js` +
`share-link.spec.js`) drives the full application flow over a DEV-only framework
seam (`window.__anchorStarterSeams`, installed by `fakes.js` and statically
stripped from production): boot → onboarding guidance → soft-gated placement →
the `?show=` URL round-trip → copy-link success/failure. See the plan and its
tiers in
[2026-06-01-anchor-starter-e2e-test-plan.md](../../../gps-plus-slam/GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-06-01-anchor-starter-e2e-test-plan.md).
