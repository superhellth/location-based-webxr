/**
 * Setup state machine — the pedagogical core of the persistent-anchor
 * starter example.
 *
 * It encodes the sequential first-user-experience as an explicit, named,
 * pure finite state machine instead of inline `if`/flag glue.
 *
 * Two branches, chosen at boot by "is there a cached anchor?":
 *
 *   cache-miss:  booting → awaiting-tracking ⇄ ready-to-place
 *                          → (PLACE_REQUESTED) saving
 *                          → (PLACE_SUCCEEDED) saved        [prompt reload]
 *                          → (PLACE_FAILED)    back to placeable + error
 *                          → (PLACE_BLOCKED)   stays placeable + hint (no save)
 *
 *   cache-hit:   booting → relocalising → (tracking ready) anchor-shown
 *
 * Placement is **soft-gated** (decision D2): the user may place the anchor
 * at any point in the placement branch; tracking-readiness only drives a
 * *recommendation* (surfaced by the onboarding guidance meter), never a
 * hard block. The async place/save follows the repo async-UX rule: the
 * `saving` phase is the in-progress state and resolves to either `saved`
 * (final) or back to a placeable phase carrying `errorMessage` (revert).
