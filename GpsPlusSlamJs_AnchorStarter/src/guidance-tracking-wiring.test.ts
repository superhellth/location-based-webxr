/**
 * Regression test for the onboarding-guidance ↔ tracking wiring.
 *
 * Why this matters: the coaching widget reads its phase from the
 * tracking-quality report (`selectTrackingQuality` → `computeOnboardingGuidance`).
 * That report only leaves the `ar-lost` state once AR poses are dispatched into
 * the store (`poseReceived`), because the aggregator forces `ar-lost` whenever
 * `tracking.phase !== 'tracking'` (see the framework's `tracking-quality.ts`).
 *
 * The framework's WebXR session only forwards per-frame poses into the store
 * when BOTH `setTrackingStore(store)` AND `setTrackingCallbacks(...)` were wired
 * before `initAR()` (its `updateTrackingState()` early-returns otherwise). The
 * starter originally wired only the former, so no `poseReceived` ever reached
 * the store, `tracking.phase` stayed `initializing`, and the guidance widget was
 * pinned to "AR tracking lost" forever with no progress — exactly the reported
 * symptom.
 *
 * This test pins the contract `main.ts` must satisfy: the guidance is stuck at
 * `ar-lost` while no pose flows in, and only advances once poses are dispatched.
 * It is the executable proof of the bug; if the pose flow regresses again, this
 * fails.
