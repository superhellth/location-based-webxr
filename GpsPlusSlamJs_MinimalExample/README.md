# gps-plus-slam minimal example

The smallest end-to-end consumer of
[`gps-plus-slam-app-framework`](../GpsPlusSlamJs_AppFramework/) — a single-file
Vite app that boots `createSlamAppStore()`, then enters a **GPS + AR hit-test**
session: an app-rendered "Enable GPS AR" button starts an immersive-ar session
and a reticle tracks real-world surfaces under the screen centre.

It is a structural port of the stock three.js `webxr_ar_hittest` example
(button → AR session → reticle → tap-to-place), adapted for the GPS-aligned
framework. The full design rationale lives in the plan doc
[2026-06-03-threejs-arbutton-minimal-ar-example-user-feedback.md](../../gps-plus-slam/GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-06-03-threejs-arbutton-minimal-ar-example-user-feedback.md).

## The two framework deltas (what a porting developer must not get wrong)

1. **App-rendered button.** Unlike three.js' `ARButton` (which injects its own
   DOM), the framework exposes the permission / enter-AR *sequence* as a
   headless controller (`createEnableGpsArController`). The app renders and
   styles its **own** `<button>` over the controller's observable state.
2. **Parenting.** Placed AR content (here, the reticle) is added under
   `getArWorldGroup()` (AR-local space), **not** the GPS-aligned scene root
   (`getScene()`). This is the single most important line to get right.

## What you'll see (the contrast demo)

The example is a teaching ladder that ends in a deliberate side-by-side
comparison. Once AR is running and the first GPS fix has arrived, **tap** to
place two markers near the real-world spot you tapped:

- an **orange cube** parented to the GPS-aligned `scene` root with **no drift
  compensation** — the _intentional floater_. It spawns a short fixed distance
  to the side of the tap (so it doesn't occlude the sphere) and, as SLAM
  tracking and GPS disagree over time, it visibly slides further away from where
  you placed it.
- a **green sphere** anchored with `createGpsAnchor` under `arWorldGroup`,
  placed exactly on the tapped point. It holds the tapped pose while it samples
  GPS (default bootstrap), then makes a single lazy correction to the GPS median
  **while off-screen** (`snap-when-offscreen`) — so it stays put from the user's
  point of view. Later corrections ease in smoothly rather than teleporting.

The two markers spawn a short fixed distance apart so they are individually
visible from the start (an early field test reported the coincident pair looking
like a single object). Taps before the first GPS fix are ignored with a brief
"waiting for GPS…" hint.

## Why this exists

1. **Onboarding scaffold.** The full
   [recorder app](../GpsPlusSlamJs_RecorderApp/) is too big to read as
   a "hello world". This example is intentionally minimal so the AR wiring is
   obvious. For the next step up — a readable AR + GPS + persistence demo — see
   the [`GpsPlusSlamJs_AnchorStarter`](../GpsPlusSlamJs_AnchorStarter/) starter
   (minimal → **starter** → full).
2. **Anonymous-install proof.** The package declares only
   `gps-plus-slam-app-framework: workspace:*` for the sibling package — a clean
   `pnpm install` at the public-repo root that successfully resolves the
   framework.

## Run it

```bash
# from the public repo root
pnpm install
pnpm --filter gps-plus-slam-minimal-example dev
```

Then open the printed URL **on an AR-capable device** (e.g. an Android phone
with WebXR / immersive-ar). On unsupported devices the button stays disabled
with an explanatory label.

## Layout

- [index.html](index.html) — bare entry: status panel, AR container
  (`#ar-root`) and the "Enable GPS AR" button.
- [src/main.ts](src/main.ts) — WebXR glue: button wiring over the controller,
  hit-test source + reticle loop (verified manually on-device).
- Reticle view-model: the framework's `hit-test-reticle.ts`
  (`createReticleMesh` / `updateReticle`, imported from
  `gps-plus-slam-app-framework/visualization`).
- [src/placement.ts](src/placement.ts) — pure tap-to-place view-model: the GPS
  gate + the deliberate scene-root floater (unit-tested in
  [src/placement.test.ts](src/placement.test.ts)).
- [src/co-spawn.ts](src/co-spawn.ts) — pure contrast co-spawn: places the
  floater cube and a `createGpsAnchor` marker at the same world pose under
  different parents (unit-tested in [src/co-spawn.test.ts](src/co-spawn.test.ts)).
- [src/status.ts](src/status.ts) — pure formatter for the status text
  (unit-tested in [src/status.test.ts](src/status.test.ts)).
- [src/boot.test.ts](src/boot.test.ts) — headless smoke test that the framework
  imports resolve and `createSlamAppStore({ NullStorageBackend })` boots
  (keeps CI AR-hardware-free).
