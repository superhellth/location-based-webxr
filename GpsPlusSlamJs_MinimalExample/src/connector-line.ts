/**
 * Connector line for the Step 4 contrast demo.
 *
 * The demo spawns pairs of a GPS-anchored **sphere** (under `arWorldGroup`) and
 * a deliberate floater **cube** (under the GPS-aligned `scene` root). Over time
 * the cube drifts away from the sphere — that drift is the whole teaching point.
 * With multiple pairs on screen it becomes hard to tell which cube belongs to
 * which sphere, so this module draws a red line from each sphere to its own cube
 * and stretches it live as the pair separates.
 *
 * Design (the simplest thing that works): the line is a **child of the sphere**.
 * One vertex is therefore permanently the sphere origin (local `0,0,0`) and only
 * the *other* vertex is updated each frame to the cube's current world pose,
 * expressed in the sphere's local frame via `sphere.worldToLocal`. So per frame
 * we only recompute and write a single endpoint; the line rides the sphere's
 * own transform (the GPS alignment applied to `arWorldGroup`) for free.
