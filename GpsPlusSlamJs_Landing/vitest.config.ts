// Vitest scoping for the landing page. All unit tests are colocated under
// `src/`; the Playwright e2e specs live in `playwright-tests/*.spec.js` and
// must never be collected by Vitest (they import @playwright/test, which
// throws under a foreign runner) — scoping `include` to `src` keeps the two
// runners separated, mirroring the sibling apps. Unit tests run in the
// default node environment — modules that touch browser APIs (matchMedia,
// localStorage, scroll metrics) take them as injected seams instead of
// globals, which keeps the suite fast and deterministic.
