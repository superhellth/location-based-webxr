/**
 * channels.mjs — the per-channel publishing rules, as data.
 *
 * Plan decision D3 requires the autonomy level to be "explicit, versioned
 * state the pipeline reads, not a property of the code": every channel starts
 * at review-everything, and each graduates to agent-published individually,
 * when the owner is satisfied with that channel's output. Graduating a channel
 * is therefore a one-word edit here rather than a change to the scheduler.
 *
 * Two channels can never graduate, for reasons outside this repo:
 *
 * - **X** — its rules sanction API posting and prohibit browser automation,
 *   and there is no free API tier for new developers. The free route is a
 *   prefilled composer that a human sends (D17).
 * - **Medium** — stopped issuing API tokens to new integrations on
 *   2025-01-01. Its browser import tool is the only route.
 *
 * Hacker News has no write API at all, so its terminal state is structural
 * rather than a policy choice; Reddit's is a policy choice this project makes
 * deliberately.
 *
 * Plan: GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-08-20-0555-marketing-content-automation-plan.md
