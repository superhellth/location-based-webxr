/**
 * Scroll-linked copy color (round-14 R14-4): highlight words (amber GPS,
 * red anchors, AR blue, …) START colorless as their copy block fades in
 * at the BOTTOM of the screen and reach FULL color only as the block
 * rises toward the TOP — timed to the matching 3D beat during the camera
 * journey, so the reader asks "why is that word colored?".
 *
 * This module is the PURE driver: from a copy element's top position (in
 * viewport pixels) it returns a 0→1 `strength` that main.ts writes to the
 * element's `--hl-strength` CSS var; the CSS lerps each highlight from
 * `--text` to its target color by that strength. Bands are expressed as
 * FRACTIONS of the viewport height, so the timing is viewport-independent
 * (portrait phone vs desktop) — the same lesson as the piecewise
 * scroll→timeline mapping.
