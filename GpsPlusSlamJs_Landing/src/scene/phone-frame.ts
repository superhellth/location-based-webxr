 * The simulated AR view of the dive chapter: a phone frame whose

 * level. The AR content itself (trail arrows, POI pin, hinted label)
 * lives in the world (`clay-world`'s ar-content group) and is seen
 * through the window — round-1 feedback killed the earlier screen-plane
 * overlays, which pointed nowhere and confused the message.
 *
 * Starts hidden; the story timeline raises and reveals it in front of the
 * camera during the dive and hides it again afterwards.
