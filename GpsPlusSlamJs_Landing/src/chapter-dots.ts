 * Landing does not depend on the framework package — its dependencies are
 * three, animejs, postprocessing and uqr — and adding that edge to a marketing
 * site so it can share ten lines of string replacement is the worse trade. So
 * the copy stays.
 *
 * It is NOT character-identical to the framework's and cannot be: that package
 * sets `singleQuote: true` and this one takes prettier's default, so the two
 * files disagree on every quote in the table below. What must stay identical is
 * the CONTRACT — the same five characters mapped to the same five entities —
 * and `tests/repo-config/escape-html-copies.test.js` compares exactly that,
 * plus the regex's character class. Editing the table below without editing the
 * framework's turns that test red.
 *
 * It used to escape FOUR characters, missing `'`. That was safe only by
 * accident of its single call site — an `aria-label="…"` attribute, where an
 * apostrophe cannot break out. Two implementations mean two chances to miss a
 * character class, which is the whole reason the guard exists.
