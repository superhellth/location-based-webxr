/**
 * Scroll → story-state mapping (the page's chapter state machine).
 *
 * The reference point is the *viewport-center line* in document
 * coordinates (`scrollY + viewportHeight / 2`): a chapter is active while
 * that line is inside its `<section>`, which matches what a reader
 * perceives as "the chapter I am looking at". Gaps between sections (from
 * margins) belong to the previous section with progress clamped at 1, so
 * the story never flickers back and forth at boundaries.
 *
 * `storyProgress` is PIECEWISE per section (round-13 follow-up): the
 * center line at fraction f of section i maps to `(i + f) / N`. Because
 * every chapter owns exactly 1/N of the timeline no matter how tall its
 * section rendered, the copy↔3D-beat pairing is viewport-independent —
 * the previous linear mapping ran the 3D beats up to a chapter ahead of
 * the copy on a landscape phone (the CTA section is far taller than the
 * rest). The trade-off is accepted: taller sections scrub their chapter
 * window slower.
 *
 * All outputs are clamped: chapterIndex ∈ [0, sections.length-1],
 * chapterProgress and storyProgress ∈ [0, 1], and the mapping is
 * monotone AND continuous in scrollY (pinned by property tests) — the 3D
 * timeline scrub relies on all of it.
